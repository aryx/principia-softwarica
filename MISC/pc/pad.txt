This bootsector comes from ???, was then copied on a SD card, then
modified by cfdisk to assume the presence of a partition of 100MB after
the first sector (so from sector 1 to 204801),
and was finally copied back from the disk to this file. 
It is used to create hard disk images (see 'mk disk').

PS: I was only able to resize with cfdisk. Both fdisk and gparted
failed.
