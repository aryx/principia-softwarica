Those files come from Raspberry Pi disk image provided
by Richard Miller??? They come themselves from
the Raspberry PI website???

Those files are recognized by the Raspberry PI firmware
(really the broadcom firmware) to boot the kernel
specified in config.txt. This firmware understands
the VFAT partition format.
