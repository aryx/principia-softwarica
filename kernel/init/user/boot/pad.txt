Note that the C files in this directory are not really useful.
We can remove all of that and just use a $objtype/boot.rc!
(this is what Richard Miller did in his bcm/pifat kernel).

At the same time it can be useful to have also a simple init example
that does not require rc.

But at least all those startboot, and intermediate bootbcp.c files
could be deleted. It was made to be more configurable
but I have an hardcoded configuration so I could simplify things.
