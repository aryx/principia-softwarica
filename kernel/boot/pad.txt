todo: could remove all of that and just have a boot.rc!
no need make this boot binary! do like in bcm/

At the same time it can be useful to have also a simple init example
that does not require rc.

but at least all those startboot, and intermediate bootbcp.c files
could be deleted. It was made to be more configurable
but I have an hardcoded configuration anyway.
