organisation:

Declare also in portfns_xxx.h the functions defined in 386/ which
are used in port code.
So put in the fns_xxx.h functions used only inside 386/.

Same for portdat_xxx.h, or at least declare in comments the
structures that are defined in 386/ but used outside in port.

Try to put the data (dat) and prototype (fns) closer to their relevant
directory (even though it can introduce backward dependencies).
I used to have a giant portdat_core.h but this was not good.
