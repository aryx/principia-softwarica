** spirit:

split in subdirectories instead of having the very flag port/ and pc/
Generalize what they have done for ip/ and boot/ and add concurrency/,
memory/, etc.

split portdat.h in subfiles, help understand things more
gradually. Make dependencies more clear.
Try to put the data ([port]dat) and prototype ([port]fns) closer to their
relevant directory (even though it can introduce backward dependencies).
I used to have a giant portdat_core.h but this was not good.

split portfns.h in subfiles, again help understand components.

Declare also in portfns_xxx.h the functions defined in 386/ which
are used in port/ code.
So put in the fns_xxx.h files, functions used only inside 386/.

Same for portdat_xxx.h, or at least declare in comments the
structures that are defined in 386/ but used outside in port.

** notes

I use // to comment, so it's easy to see if the code comes from me
(and no need verbose //pad:)
