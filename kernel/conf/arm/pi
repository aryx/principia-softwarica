# -*- sh -*-
# A simple kernel configuration for running under Raspberry Pi 1.

# The format of this file is:
#  <section>
#  TAB<file>SPACE+<file_dependencies>*
#
# You must use TABs, and not spaces for indenting entries in a section.
# Moreover, the 'dev' section entries have an implicit 'dev' prefixed to <file>,
# so an entry like  'draw  vgascreen foo' really means that it will link
# devdraw.c (and that this file then depends on vgascreen.c and foo.c).
#
# This file is processed by the script ../port/mkdevc
