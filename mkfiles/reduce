#pad: I think grep works differently on macOS so if the reduce.$pid is empty

#pad: the s/^/^/ above is to add a ^ in the reduce.pid file so the
# filename becomes a regexp that matches only at the beginning. 
# Without it the 'runestrxxx' would not be compiled because there is
# some strxxx in ../$objtype/
