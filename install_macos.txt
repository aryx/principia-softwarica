Modern macOS should come with a working C compiler (/usr/bin/cc
should point to the Clang compiler), git, and a few
other basic utilities. If not, install Xcode from the App store.

Install brew, a package manager for macOS: http://brew.sh

Install a few brew packages:
 $ brew install qemu
 $ brew install dosfstools

Then follow the same instructions than in install_linux.txt
