I've made a few modifications to this directory:
 - I put pcc/ here instead of at the top of sys/src/cmd (or instead
   of in compilers/)
 - I put the include/ape here instead of in sys/include
   and did the same for 386/include/ape and arm/include/ape which
   are now instead subdirs of ape/include.

The reasons for all of that is to gather all ape related things
in this directory to not pollute my other directories.

Note that for pcc to work you'll need to have
/bin/8c and /bin/8l

(I used also to require to have a /bin/rc for the genall script in 
ape/lib/9syscall/ but I now do it in another way)


Note that you need a /386/bin/ape/sh for the system() posix
function to work. Right now I just copied rc.
