Install pad's fork of kencc:
 - git clone https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - see fork-kencc/install_linux.txt to install necessary dependencies
 - cd fork-kencc; ./configure; . env; mk; mk install
 => /path/to/fork-kencc/bin will contain 8a, 8c, 8l, the cross 
    assembler/compiler/loader needed to compile plan9/

Install plan9port:
 - download the latest of plan9port 
 - install libxt-dev package, otherwise you will get a compilation error
 - ./INSTALL to compile and install
 - because the mkfiles in plan9/ assume a mk that is paired with
   the rc shell, you need to modify plan9port/src/cmd/mk/shell.c and
   put rcshell as the default shell and recompile/reinstall plan9port
    - Shell *shelldefault = &shshell;
    + Shell *shelldefault = &rcshell;
 => /path/to/plan9port/bin will contain mk, rc, and a few other tools used
    when building plan9/
