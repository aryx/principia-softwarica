Install pad's fork of kencc:
 - git clone https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - see fork-kencc/install_linux.txt to install the required dependencies
 - compile kencc:
    $ cd fork-kencc/
    $ ./configure
    $ . ./env
    $ mk
    $ mk install

 => /path/to/fork-kencc/bin will contain 8a, 8c, and 8l (the cross 
    assembler/compiler/linker needed to compile plan9) as well as
    rc, mk, sed, etc.

Adapt env.sh to your configuration, source it, and run mk
(which will then use, rc, 8a, 8c, 8l, etc)
