Install first pad's fork of kencc:
 - git clone https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - see fork-kencc/install_linux.txt to install the required dependencies
   (mainly a gcc targeting 32 bits architecture)
 - compile kencc:
    $ cd fork-kencc/
    $ ./configure
    $ . ./env
    $ mk
    $ mk install

 => /path/to/fork-kencc/bin will contain 8a, 8c, and 8l (the cross 
    assembler, compiler, and linker needed to compile plan9) as well as
    many plan9 utilities (rc, mk, sed, etc.)

Adapt env.sh to your configuration, source it, and run mk
(which will then use, rc, 8a, 8c, 8l, etc.) from the root:
  $ cd /path/to/fork-plan9
  $ mk
  $ mk kernels
  $ mk install

This should compile all the plan9 programs and install the generated 
binaries in fork-plan9/ROOT/386/bin or fork-plan9/ROOT/arm/bin
depending on your target.
