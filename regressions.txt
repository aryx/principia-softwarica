* SYS/src/9/pc/mouse2.c: WEIRD, if rename this to mouse.c,
then get a black screen when execute vga -l in boot.rc.
No cursor, nothing. WEIRD because if name it mouse2.c, then
link at different position in 9qemu and then it works.

running colors under rio sometimes generate some
"entries" suicide!
not sure when this started

5c does not work anymore. It does not parse even a simple helloworld.c

for a long time, if you move the mouse during the boot, then you get
an error.

At boot time there is some acpi error about time > other time.
