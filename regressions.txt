* when exit from rio-ocaml, the terminal does not work very well

* FIXED? rio does not work under QEMU-386! suicide
UPDATE: make clean; make maybe helped. Now it works

* hellorio in ocaml and rio in ocaml sometimes get a suicide trap.
Not sure why. pb about reading addr 0x5

* FIXED? SYS/src/9/pc/swcursor.c: WEIRD even if I do not use any func in it,
if I link in this module then I can not run rio. I get a kernel fault
when I run rio. So right now I can not factorize the code
in pc/screen.c to use the globals and functions from swcursor.c
UPDATE: seems I can now link, so probably a weird bug in 5l that occurs
sometimes.

* SYS/src/9/pc/mouse2.c: if I rename this file to mouse.c
then I get a black screen when I execute vga -l in boot.rc.
No cursor, nothing. WEIRD because if I name it mouse2.c then 5l
links the module at a different position in 9qemu and then it works.

* running colors under rio generate some suicide! when I put the cursor
inside its window. Not sure when this started.

* 5c does not work anymore when run under plan9. 
It does not parse even a simple helloworld.c.

* If I move the mouse during the boot, then I get an error
and I can not run rio.
It started a long time ago.

* At boot time there is some acpi error about 'time > other time'.
It started a long time ago.
