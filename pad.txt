* Compile

** Environment

First need to source env.sh to setup the right environment 
(essentially to find the compilers in kencc/ and rc/mk in plan9user).

Need also to set /386 /sys/ /lib appropriate symlinks.
Need also /bin/mk and /bin/rc symlinks.

* Todo

- put back exits(1) in panic() in devcons!

less:
 - remove printing stuff (plan9999, boooooooting)
 - fix kencc to support va_args macro
