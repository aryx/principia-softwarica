To compile plan9, as well as to compile kencc (which is required 
to compile plan9), you will first need to install the (32 bits) Cygwin
environment:  see https://www.cygwin.com/ and the setup-x86.exe
installer program (not setup-x86_64.exe).
See install_windows.txt in my fork of kencc to install kencc.

Install QEMU for windows: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/
Install OSFMount for windows: https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html

Then follow the same instructions than in install_linux.txt
until the 'mk disk' step.

To build a disk image containing Plan9, you will need to
use the OSFMount program. First make an empty dosdisk.img
file with:
  $ mk disk

Then run OSFMount and select "Mount new".

In the dialog box click on the "..." to select the
dosdisk.img file (which under cygwin should be located
under c:/cygwin32/home/xxx/fork-plan9/dosdisk.img).
Select Partition 0 in the dialog box (not "entire image file").
Then modify the "Drive size" text entry and put 204801.
Select the drive letter "Z:".
Uncheck the "Read-only drive" radio button
and check the "Mount as removable media".
Finally click OK.

Then select the drive and in the Drive actions menu select "Format".
Select Fat32 in the filesystem pull-down menu
and click on "Start".
Select YES and OK to the following dialogs to format
the file.

At this point you should be able to add files under Z:

Go back to the cygwin terminal under fork-plan9 and enter:
  $ mk disk2

Finally you can run and test this image under QEMU
after modifying the PATH to find qemu:
  $ export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/qemu:$PATH
  $ mk run

Et voila!
