* TODO
- pi2 (and qemu?), pi4 (arm64)
- riscv support orange pi (and tinyemu?)
- latte pc (amd64?)

** test infra
- add shell.nix
- add test infra to check for regressions

* 0.22 (Q4 2025) (LPization ed.c in Principia.nw, compile with goken??)
- LPization ed.c in Principia.nw
- TODO: compile principia with goken

* 0.21 (Q3 2025) (LPization v1 Utilities.nw)
# started work on goken9cc to replace kencc and unify with principia's code

- first Lpized version of Utilities.nw (that also compiles in goken)

* 0.20 (Q2 2025) (Dockerfile, resume build)

** build infra
- resume build principia and dosdisk.img and 9qemu for pc/386 thx
  to kencc (and 9-cc from david colombier). It builds and run again via Qemu!
  Last time was in 2018 according to the date of 9qemu. Rio is
  also working (not sure why I was worried it was not working anymore).
- resume build principia and dosdisk.img and 9pi for pi/arm.
  It builds and run again on my (real) Rasperry Pi 1.
  Last time was in 2018 according to the date of 9pi. Rio is also working.

** test infra
- Dockerfile and docker.yml Github Actions CI

* ----------------------------------------------------------------

* Big pause to work on semgrep for 2019/2020/2021/2022/2023/2024

* 0.19 (Q3 2018) (LPization v1 Widgets.nw)
# Big vacation in Europe (1 month), and buying house and moving process

- LP split Widgets.nw
- mk pdf, mk all, mk sync for everything! can build everything,
  including all the books from scratch, with up-to-date code indexing

* 0.18 (Q2 2018) (Linux and Windows support)

- big code reorganization and changes to mkfiles to (cross)compile
  also under Linux and Cygwin (in additon to macOS)
#(got a surface book 2 so opportunity to experiment with different OSes)
- simplifiy mkfiles, remove need for symlinks, remove need for
  /386 and /arm by using instead $TOP and $ROOT variables in mkfiles,
  so again easier to cross compile from Linux or Cygwin
- simplified the core mkfiles too (mkone, mklib, etc.)
- can now cross-compile from Linux
- remove need for certain utilities or command-line options
  (e.g, ls -p) so need less commands from kencc/ 
- no need for plan9port anymore 
(thx to a bigger fork-kencc)
- can now cross-compile from Windows (via cygwin)
- can build pc and pi targets from Linux/macOS/Cygwin hosts

!!Finished first lpized versions for almost all principia components!!
except for Libc/Profiler/Utilities.nw. 
Added a few other though (Efuns, OCaml, Mmm).

- OCaml, continue extensions (backtrace)
  and port to plan9!
- Efuns, continue extensions (minimap, position history, etc),
  and port to plan9!
- first lpized versions for
  * Lex/yacc Generator (actually ocamllex and my own ocamlyacc)
  * Network
  * Debugger (very partial)

   * Machine, Assembler, Linker, Compiler, 
   * Graphics, Window, Shell,
   * Make, 
    with each time a similar procedure summarized in Template.nw
- switched to ARM, starting with Machine.nw, and then Assembler.nw, Linker.nw


* 0.3 (Q3 2014) (pfff -lpize finer-grained split)

spent time on datalog and graph_code_c to answer questions I had while looking
at the kernel, such as who calls that, what constants can flow in this
integer field

- started Window.nw, Make.nw, etc.
- pfff -lpize which not only split in files but also split entities
  (thx to better pfff -parse_c), so quicker to get a first workable
  literate document
- change code to get codegraph -lang c to work on, and also introduced many
  globals.c to remove some backward dependencies.
- codegraph now works (conservatively) on the whole plan9

syncweb: pfff -lpize finer-grained split

* 0.2 (Q2 2014) (Kernel.nw)

- made a first version of the literate program for the kernel, good TOC,
  Kernel.nw
- almost full LPization, 20 chapters!!, aspectize, lp split, reorg again,
  try to understand almost every parts of the code, simplified the code many
  times (e.g. for virtual memory), removed dead code, renamed important
  structures (e.g. Mach -> Cpu, m->cpus, externup removal), added arch/, 
  get rid of edf.c, aspectized advanced virtual memory (MAXKPA), rename
  Pte to pagetable, more consistent pte, pt, pde, pd, mmupxxx
- 4 or 5 bugs reported on 9fans!

syncweb: -lpize initial, M-x pad-literate-split refresh

* 0.1 (Q1 2014) (fork kencc and plan9, cross compile whole distro from Mac)

- got kencc working on my mac (but had to backport features from pLan9 labs 8c
  such as ELF support, and later some fixes related to unicode)
- forked kencc, cg/cm on kencc

- was able to cross compile from macOS
   * the kernel, and then 
   * all the utilities, 
   * libraries
  (xv6 was actually hard to cross compile on macOS, binutils sucked)
- forked plan9 with the idea of making a xix based on plan9. I simplified 
  the code, removed support for some architectures, device drivers, etc
  I reorganized also a lot the code (and use xmv and symlinks to be compatible)
- was able to get to work on my own plan9 fork and my own plan9 distribution:
   * the kernel (via qemu -kernel), 
   * mini shell,
   * full shell,
   * dossrv
   * rio 
   * the network 
  very quick iterative loop!
- simplified a lot the kernel, removed many syscalls, lots of dead code,
  reorg in different directories. Used codemap/codegraph on .clang/.clang2
  and introduced hook to remove some backward deps, split portdat.h, dat.h, etc,
  used scheck on plan9 code, annotated code with @scheck for false positives
- read balestero's notes on plan9 kernel

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* Alpha (Dec 2013) (it runs!)
# Christmas vacation playing with plan9 at Menlo Park

- got Plan9 working on Virtual Box and then QEMU (was not that easy,
  QEMU had some bugs and Plan9-labs was not very QEMU friendly),
- played with rio! (30 dec 2013, just before new year :) )
