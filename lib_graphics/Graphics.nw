%thx to LP, I changed for the better a few things:
% - removed deadcode (Displaybufsize, drawbuf/ndrawbuf, Display.dataqid,
%    Display.isnew (many stuff), Memdata.imref, convxx[], fillxxx(), mkfont(),
%    openmemsubfont(), stringsubfont(), ... 
%    and more (see the %dead in this file)
% - screen.h cleaner interface (taking as inspiration the raspberry plan9 code)
% - renamed some globals (screen -> view, _screen -> screen TODO desktop)
%   TODO gscreen, screenimage, vgascr, so easier to see associated part
%   TODO or merge globals (screenimage and gscreen, can?)
% - TODO transformed globals in locals (softscreen)
% - reorganized a lot the files; I merged many small files in bigger one
%   (e.g., libdraw/subfont.c), or split in different files to better
%   separate concerns (e.g., draw.h in window.h and font.h and draw_private.h)

%thx to codemap/codegraph/scheck:
% - SEMI use cg to reduce backward deps, introduce globals.c, utils.c,
%   (harder to understand non layered code)
% - TODO use scheck to remove deadcode, dead prototypes, useless export
%   or mv as forward decl
%   (harder to understand big interface files)
% - TODO use cg to reduce number of globals by moving them closer to the
%   relevant file (or even function), better cluster the code
%   (harder to understand non functional code using lots of globals)

%thx to this manual, I better understand:
%  - graphics terminology (I didn't take the Image option at INSA)
%  - graphics history, with Postscript, PDF, Display Postscript, Cairo, Xlib
%  - raster vs vector graphics, discrete pixels vs continuous geometry shapes
%  - bitblt(), which I often heard of but never really understood what it was
%  - channels are the size spec for the different pixel components
%    and the source of many pixel formats
%  - alpha channel is a way to encode transparency strength for compositing
%    operations at a pixel granularity (very flexible)
%  - TODO pre-alpha vs post-alpha?
%  - clipping is to restrict operations on a rectangle
%  - tiling is replicating a simple pattern repeatidely
%  - antialiasing is just a simple way to remove effect d'escalier by setting
%    the lightness of a pixel to be function of its distance to the ideal point,
%    so clearer text at the cost of slight blur
%  - SEMI scanline algorithm for polygons (subtle)
%  - TODO Bezier (could be useful for edge bundling visual in codemap?)

\chapter{Introduction}

The goal of this book is to present with full details the source code of
a {graphics system}.

\section{Motivations}

Why a graphics system? 
Because I think you are a better programmer if
you fully understand how things work under the hood, and
with so many fancy graphics on your screen, there are plenty
of things happening under the hood to understand.


\n Definition. Could be in Principles, but better def now as GS is a bit vague.
A {graphics system} provides essentially an
application programming interface (API) to draw things:
lines, rectangles, circles, text, etc.
It can also mediate access to a shared resource: the {screen}.
\l 'can mediate' cos not always; more role of windowing system in the end.
\l also a bit to give access to the mouse and raw keyboard (mouse.h, keyboard.h)
%
Graphics systems are usually coupled with a {windowing system}
to form a {graphical user interface} (GUI).
\l hmm actually can have a GUI without a windowing system
%history:
GUIs, introduced in the 1970's with the Xerox Alto~\cite{alto},
were a vast improvement over {text-based} user interfaces, to
the point where every mainstream operating systems now come with a GUI
(e.g., Microsoft Windows, macOS and iOS, Linux with X Window, or Android).



Graphics systems are usually implemented by a combination of hardware 
and software. In fact, modern graphics systems rely more and more on
specialized hardware, especially for {3D operations}.
\n I assume you know what 3D/2D means
%
However, in this book, I will cover only {2D operations}, implemented mostly
in software. I will assume very little from the graphics hardware.
\n a frame buffer, see also VGA appendix
%
Even though 2D operations are usually covered quickly
in books about computer graphics (e.g.,~\cite{cgpp-foley}),
where the focus is more on 3D and advanced rendering techniques,
the result of simple 2D operations is what most people see
on their screen.
\n STEPS also focused on 2D (they say 2.5D)
%
Indeed, most graphical applications use simple
drawing primitives such as functions to draw
lines, rectangles, or text.
Those primitives are the foundation of even the 
{windowing systems} themselves.
%
Indeed, the \book{Windows}, which covers
the \plan windowing system, relies only on 
the simple functions described in this book.


Here are a few questions I hope this book will answer:
\begin{itemize}

\item Which low-level instructions allow to modify the screen?
\n can relate to Assembler.nw

\item How is the picture on the screen represented in the machine?
What is a {frame buffer}?

\item How do the kernel and graphics system provide and protect access to 
the screen?

\n how to manage multiple processes wanting to access shared resource?
\n  hmm more a windowing system issue than graphic system issue

\item How are images represented in memory? 
How are they stored on the disk? 
What is the format of a JPEG file?
\l image vs picture?
\n actually we will see related one, creadimage
\l alok think same than frame buffer, but can be ARGB32 vs RGB24!

\item How are graphical elements such as 
rectangles, 
lines, 
or circles,
rendered on the screen? 
How does the graphics card help? 

\item What is the algorithm to draw arbitrary lines
(non-vertical and non-horizontal lines)
on a rectangular grid of pixels (the screen)?
\n actually we will see fillpolygon

\item How are colors represented in the machine?
What does ``{True Color}'' mean?

\item What is the {alpha channel}? 
What is {alpha compositing}? 
%What is {alpha blending}?
\n I dont even know diff between blending and compositing; alok neither.

\item What is the {rasterization} process? 
What is {vector graphics}?

\item How are characters drawn on the screen? 
How {fonts} are managed? 
What are ``{True Type}'' fonts? 
\n in fact not implemented by /dev/draw

\item What is {anti-aliasing}?
\n in fact not implemented by /dev/draw
% What is subpixel rendering?

\item How is the mouse cursor handled?
Where are saved the pixels that were under the cursor?
How those pixels are restored on the screen when the mouse moves?
\l which forces us to talk about how mouse is handled

\item How does the introduction of graphics and the mouse change
the programming model of an application?
What are the differences between a command-line application and
a graphical application beyond the obvious? 
%How can a graphical application {react} to a mouse event?
\n reactive model. notification oriented. events vs threads.
\l  not sequential style with input/output. event loop 
\l how to react simultaneously to two input devices, mouse and keyboard?

\end{itemize}
\l how to implement overlapping layers(window)? what is a backing store?
\l how to cooperate with windowing system?
\t how synchro with monitor balayage? glitches? API? how done in Soldat.nw?
\l memory leak with imagmem? or when close fd then freeimage in pool?

\section{The \plan{} graphics system:  [[draw]]}

I will explain in this book the code of the \plan graphics 
system\footnote{\url{http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/3/draw}},
visible to the user primarily through the [[/dev/draw/]] {device directory},
and to the programmer mostly through the [[draw.h]] header file.
\n also memdraw.h and memlayer.h, but more internals
%
Because users manipulate graphical applications with a {mouse},
I will also cover code related to the [[/dev/mouse]] {device file}
(and the [[mouse.h]] and [[cursor.h]] header files).
\n also a bit [[/dev/cons]] and [[keyboard.h]],  and [[/dev/cursor]]
%
In total, the \plan graphics system, which from now on I will 
call just [[draw]],
\n /dev/draw, draw.h, so seems like a good name
contains 23~300 lines of code (LOC),
including the code of device drivers of two common graphics cards. 
\l one for ARM, one for PC.
[[draw]] is written entirely in C.
\l part library, part kernel, part drivers. 
\n LOC includes some tests and apps.
\l portable! x86 and ARM!


%dup: from Assembler.nw
Like for most books in \principia, I chose a \plan program because
those programs are simple, small, elegant, open source, and they form together
a coherent set.
%history:
The ancestor of [[draw]], the graphics system of the Blit machine~\cite{blit},
also designed by Rob Pike, was one of the first graphics systems back in 1982. 
It was created even before the Macintosh, X Window, and Microsoft Windows.
\n comment shows the lineage and dates
% Alto -> Blit (1982, a cheap Alto, Xerox vs Bell Labs) -> .. /dev/draw (1990?)
%  79  |> Lisa (1983) -> Macintosh (1984) -> Microsoft Windows (1985) -> ...
%      |> X Window (1984) (or comes from MIT Lisp Machine?)


[[draw]] services, like many other services in \plan,
are accessible through files. Indeed, [[draw]] is a device
{\em and} a filesystem (see the \book{Kernel} if this sounds confusing).
[[draw]] manages the files under [[/dev/draw/]].
\n actually also /dev/winname
%
Because you can export filesystems through
the network in \plan, [[draw]] is also a 
{networked graphics system}, similar to X Window.
%
Thus, in \plan, programs running on one machine
can even display their results on another machine.
\l powerful! like browser! remote for free

%dup: (and changed, not-coupled) intro/motivations
In \plan, as opposed to X Window, the graphics system
and windowing system are clearly separated. 
You can use graphical applications without a windowing system running.
%
%[[draw]] provides some forms of {window management}, for instance, by giving
%the ability for applications to create {overlapping windows}, but
\l overlapping layers (similar to windows)
\l and backing store, and menus
%this is only one of the building blocks necessary to get a windowing system.
The code of the \plan windowing system, called [[rio]],
will be explained in another book (the \book{Windows}).

\l bad stuff of draw though: most of the code is in the kernel :(
% but lots of stuff can be in library and can be tested outside
% (see memdrawtest), but still a bit ugly. The images, fonts,
% reside in special kernel memory (imagmem).
% Note though that putting stuff in kernel is trendy with DRM/Xorg/wayland 
% in Linux.

\l just 2D, no 3D, mostly in software, almost no hardware acceleration, no GPU
\l no scale/rotate/translate as in cairo, so no text in diagonal, no codemap
\l No true type fonts. No subpixel rendering. No anti-aliasing.

\n there is also a draw in plan9port written by Russ Cox called drawterm,
\n  ported to many systems, including X Window! can be nice to compare the API

%pro:
% Still relevant. Model used in Go for image drawing library!
% So power some Google internal tools probably! Profiling visualization tools?
% Also source of inspiration of Cairo (cite papers by Packard who reference
% draw).

\section{Other graphics systems}

Here are a few graphics systems that I considered for this book,
but which I ultimately discarded:
\begin{itemize}

%history:
\item Xorg\furl{http://www.x.org} is the most popular open-source
implementation of the X Window System~\cite{x-window},
a graphics system (and a windowing system) designed in the 1980's at MIT.
%
It is used by all Linux distributions and has even been ported
to other operating systems such as macOS and Microsoft Windows.
%
X Window defines a protocol, X11, for
a networked client/server architecture. Clients using
a set of libraries (e.g., Xlib) communicate with
a {display server} ([[Xorg]]) to render graphics.
\n actually similar archi in plan9, but shorter!
\n now XCB seems to be preferred to Xlib, cairo has backends for Xlib and XCB
%
Xorg supports 
many graphics cards (with hardware acceleration), 
many extensions (e.g., 3D operations), and 
many operating systems.
%
However, its codebase is enormous with more than 1 million LOC,
even when counting just the code of 
the display server, 
a few core libraries, and 
a few device drivers.
\n but just xserver/{dix/,fb/,mi/} is about 70 000 LOC though.
\n and xserver/hw/kdrive/fb/ is small, a tiny X server model implementation.

\l known to be hard to understand, many tutorials on the web
\l "why X11 is so big" by Ken Thompson, partly the motivation for plan9

X Window was designed at a time where memory was 
extremely limited, and remote applications were crucial.
\l because had cheap poor graphic terminal connected to big machines
\n nice to have network, I used it at FB with emacs, but big design price to pay
Time has changed,
but this historical baggage means that even the code of simple applications
such as a graphical hello world is
very long and complicated to write~\cite{x11-hello-world}.
\l compare size of draw.h with size of any X11 header ... (or cairo, or pixman)
\l stupid expose callback, should be done by display server!
%
Some programmers wrote {toolkits} such as 
Gtk\furl{http://www.gtk.org/} or 
Qt\furl{https://www.qt.io/}
\n Xaw, Xt, FLTK, WxWindows, ...
to simplify things,
but those toolkits add another layer of complexity on something that 
is already very complicated.
%
\t imaging model a bit old, so sometimes it's just a glorified pixmal
\t  compositor. People use cairo and send just bitmap (with Xrender).
\l also drawing API in Xlib is poor. No transluscence, no compositing.
\l  no modern effects such as shadows, so many programs actually resort
\l  to external lib (e.g., cairo) and send simply bitmap to X (using X Render).
\n X Render by Keith packard was inspired by plan9 draw and rio
%dup: (and adapted) intro/motivations intro/draw
Finally, the graphics and windowing system parts of Xorg are {strongly} coupled;
this coupling makes the whole system harder to understand than [[draw]]
and [[rio]], which we can study separately.
\l x86 specific? X on Raspberry Pi?


\item Ghostscript\furl{http://www.ghostscript.com/} is an 
open source interpreter for Postscript~\cite{postscript},
a graphics language invented by Adobe and used initially in printers.
Postscript was a very influential programming language; most graphics API
today use it as a model.
\l seminal one? idea of Context? Stroke? of rotation/scale of everything(text!)
\l processing.org is a successor of that tradition?
%
\l Ghostscript not full graphics system.
However, Ghostscript is a large program, with more than 750~000 LOC.
\n not counting external dependencies, libpng, etc
\n xpost is 30~000 LOC but not complete

Note that a few graphics systems, for instance, Display Postscript (DPS) 
in the NeXT computer, or the NeWS windowing system~\cite{news-book} from Sun,
were based on Postscript and embedded a Postscript interpreter
to render graphics on the screen.
\l ancestor of Quartz for macOS (Quartz 2D is using PDF model =~ Postscript)
%
One advantage of this approach is that it is easy to print what is on
the screen when the printer also understands Postscript;
the same code can be used. Moreover,
what is printed will match exactly what is on the screen.
%
However, one disadvantage is that you have to use two languages to program a
graphical application: one for the business logic (e.g., C),
and one for the graphics (Postscript).

\t any graphics or fonts at any scale or angle (like cairo later)


\item Cairo~\cite{Xr}\furl{http://cairographics.org/} is a 2D
graphics library used in many applications (e.g., Firefox).
\l and libraries (GTK use cairo internally, so all GTK apps use cairo)
\n actually partly grew from X limitations, called Xr. User-space compositing. 
However, it is not a complete graphics system; it relies on
a ``backend'' for the final display.
% =~ Postscript + Compositing extensions (=~ PDF 1.4 model) in C, EDSL
%
It is relatively large with its 235~000 LOC 
(not including the tests and benchmark code).
\n (350~000 LOC with the tests and benchmark code),
\n originally in Xr paper it was just 7000 LOC (libtwin is small still)
but supports many drawing primitives
and many backends (e.g., X Window via Xlib, macOS via Quartz 2D).
\l can leverage hardware acceleration e.g., XRender, send directly pixmaps
\l actually use 3d hardware to optimize also 2d operations! see siggraph paper
\l win32, opengl, directFB, DRM, even now SKIA
Cairo can also generate directly graphic files with backends for
Postscript, PDF, SVG, PNG, etc.
%
In Cairo, all drawing operations are expressed in float coordinates, not pixels,
and can be transformed by any affine transformations
(rotation, scaling, translation), which is very flexible.
\t for instance can draw fonts in any orientation (also any scale)
\t more device independent because of float. but postscipt had that already?
\t  so Cairo is really Postscript spirit but as a lib, not a language.
\l openGL has also that (/dev/draw nope but could have higher-level lib with it)
\l for instance can draw Hello in diagonal in any size (and scalable fonts)
\l let the computation be done by the library! simplify user code, can do
\l  very fancy things with rotate/scale/translate (a la Postscript).

\l maybe API simpler than the one of plan9. I get confused with the 
\l complex parameters of draw(), the rectangles and point and clipping.
\l pen-based drawing model. Also PDF 1.4 imaging model.

\l toy text API, so need add Pango, freetype, fontconfig. => additional LOC!
\l  but text API in draw is alsi limited; I can't even do codemap with draw.
\n nice is cairo/BIBLIOGRAPHY file

Note that both Cairo and Xorg rely on the Pixman 
library\furl{http://www.pixman.org/}
for low-level pixel manipulation and compositing. 
This library adds another 50~000 LOC.


\item Skia\furl{https://skia.org/} is a 2D graphics library
developed by Google that is similar to Cairo.
\n written in C plus plus
It is the graphics engine of Android and Chrome.
It is also large: 485~000 LOC (without the tests).
\l anti-aliasing, subpixel text (for LCD), shaders, ... gpu/ is big
\n http://www.slideshare.net/SamsungOSG/duel-of-two-libraries-cairo-skia (ok)


\item Mesa\furl{http://www.mesa3d.org/} is a 3D graphics library
implementing the OpenGL~\cite{opengl} (Open Graphics Library)
specification. OpenGL is a standard API for rendering 2D
and 3D vector graphics.
\l also stateful, similar to Postscript/Cairo
Mesa contains a few software-based
renderers, as well as drivers supporting hardware-accelerated
operations for many graphics cards.
However, its codebase is enormous with more than 1.6 million LOC.

Mesa in some sense is more general than Cairo, Skia, or [[draw]]. Indeed,
if a function can draw a line in 3D, the same function can
be used to draw a line in 2D. However, the algorithms and geometry involved
are far more complicated to explain.
\l but being more general is better? learn once and apply for many things?
%dup: (but changed) intro/motivation
In practice, the graphics used in most applications
are 2D graphics, except for some video games and CAD software,
which is why I decided to focus on 2D graphics in this book.
%
Moreover, OpenGL does not have a good API to draw text
on the screen, even though text is fundamental, 
even in graphical applications.
\n has gouraud shading, phong?, textures, 3d rasterizer, ...
\l not good story for window integration too, and menu, and key/mouse
\l opengl and glut. the menuhit function is kinda related to glut.

\l DRM in Linux. But very low level. Not really drawing API, just
\l  an interface for mode settings and shared buffer, so need
\l  cairo to make a complete graphics system.
\l  Linux graphic archi is now super complicated: 
\l   (DRM (and GEM, KMS), DRI (in X11), fbdev, EGL?, GGI?, etc)
\l  and also just a buffer compositor, it assumes clients use cairo or openGL
\l  it just composes a set of pixmaps.

%\item Mini-X was a graphics system for MINIX modeled after X Window.
\n Mini-X, Minix :)
% A library. No display server so limited to single application.
% Can have multiple windows, line in draw, but only one app. 
% So no windowing system like Xorg (or rio and draw).
% Small 10 000 LOC, but quite limited, and dead.
\n The README says that they dont support multiple clients.
\n alive through Nano-X, a full graphics and windowing system. See Windows.nw
% http://members.canb.auug.org.au/~dbell/ (but no mini-X link)

%\item TWIN, the Tiny Window system, is, despite its name,
%just a graphics system for small devices.
% designed for sub-PDAs, e.g. watch!
% used by petitboot
% by main contributor to X, Keith Packard. Many extensions XRender.
% itself took inspiration from draw!
% TWIN start from scratch. 
% took rio as a model, again! 
% includes also some widgets, 
% 12 KLOC, so very small, with quite fancy graphics system!
% but unmaintained.
% small, also cos does not support every image format. just
% ARGB32, RGB8?, and?
\n No screenshot. Not really maintained. Was even hard to get the source.
\n not to confuse with another Twin window system in text mode, a la curses
% Twin. designed for severly memory constraints systems, sub PDAs.
% Actually not full window system, a graphics system.
% with support for overlapping windows. similar to draw. In fact
% modeled partially after draw.
% In fact not a server but lib so more limited than draw:
% single-client multiple-windows. No protocol.
% Designed by Keith Packard, developer of Xorg, many extensions.
% developer also on Cairo! He is everywhere!
% Advanced graphics: anti aliasing, scalable outline fonts,
% any affine transformation (e.g. rotation of text).
% Also widgets, layout!

\section{Getting started (x86)}
\label{sec:getting-started}

%dup: (and adapted) Assembler.mw
To play with [[draw]], you will first need to install
the \plan fork used in \principia (see \urlinstall).
Once installed, you can test [[draw]] under \plan
%x86:
on an x86 machine by executing the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
1   $ bind -a '#v' /dev
2   $ vga -l 640x480x8 
# screen should change layout
3   $ bind -a '#i' /dev

4   $ cd /tests/draw
5   $ 8c hellodraw.c
6   $ 8l hellodraw.8 -o hellowdraw
7   $ ./hellodraw
\end{verbatim}
% x86 for vga part
\l on bcm? needs to do anything? can change to 1024x768x24? instead of 16?
\l use bcm instead? and then 5c, not 8c.

You should then see on your screen
the graphics in Figure~\ref{fig:hellodraw}.

\begin{figure}\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{hellodraw}
\end{center}
\caption{[[hellodraw]] screenshot.}
\label{fig:hellodraw}
\end{figure}
\n no rio; minimal "getting started" spirit!
\t explain QEMU? or remove it!

The command in Line~1, above, installs the VGA\footnote{
VGA (Video Graphics Array) is a graphics standard for x86 machines.
\l more in appendix
}
{device driver},
which exports the VGA {device files} in [[/dev/]] (e.g., [[/dev/vgactl]]).
%
See the \book{Kernel} for more information on how device
drivers work and how to use [[bind]]. You can also read
[[docs/man/3/0intro]] for an introduction to the \plan devices.

Line~2 runs the program [[vga]]. This program internally uses
the [[/dev/vgactl]] device file to instruct the graphics card
to change the {resolution}, here to 640 by 480 with 8 bits
per pixel. The effect of this command will change the layout of the screen,
but you will still be in a {terminal textual mode}.
\n see Section X for graphical text-mode.

Line~3 then installs the [[draw]] device, which
exports the [[draw]] device files in [[/dev]] (e.g., [[/dev/draw/new]]).

Line~5 and Line~6 respectively compiles and links the simple
C program [[hellodraw.c]], which uses functions from [[draw.h]].

Finally, Line~7 executes the program, which will internally
use files under [[dev/draw/]] to create the graphics
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hellodraw}.


\section{Requirements}

%dup: from Assembler.nw
Because most of this book contains C source code, 
you will need a good knowledge of 
the C programming language~\cite{k-r} to understand it.
%
I also assume you have a basic understanding of geometry and trigonometry.
%
Books on computer graphics such as
{\em Computer Graphics, Principles and Practice}~\cite{cgpp-foley}
\l Principle of Interactive Computer Graphics, Newman and Sproull, McGraw-Hill
% seems seminal book about vector graphics, and source for GKS, in 1979
% (from pike84bitblt.pdf), even cited by Alto paper. But "interactive"?
would be useful, especially for Chapter~\ref{chap:drawing-shapes},
which contains the algorithms do draw shapes (e.g., lines, ellipses).
However, those books are not mandatory; most computer graphics books
focus on 3D, which I do not cover at all.
\n actually CGPP3 does not even cover scanline algo apparently. so sad.
\n CS overview by brookshear covers only 3D.

I strongly suggest reading the \book{Kernel} before reading
this book, especially for Chapter~\ref{chap:user-kernel-bridge},
which describes the user-to-kernel bridge.
Indeed, an important part of [[draw]] resides
in the kernel and implements interfaces such as [[Dev]]
defined by the kernel.
[[draw]] is implemented as a device;
\l and a filesystem
I assume you know what is a {device file} for instance.

\t to as in Windows.nw instead? "If while reading this book you have questions''
It can also be useful to read the many manual pages concerning
[[draw]]. Those pages are located under [[docs/man/]]
in my \plan repository.
Here is a partial list of those pages and a short description
of their content:
\t relevant pages to draw, as in Windows.nw

\begin{itemize}

\item [[2/graphics]]: the big picture (no pun intented)
\t a few changes though, like screen -> view

\item [[2/draw]]: the [[draw.h]] API

\item [[2/memdraw]]: the drawing functions used
in the kernel

\item [[3/draw]]: the [[draw]] {protocol} (supported
by the [[/dev/draw/x/data]] file)
\t can not understand that

\item [[6/image]]: the \plan image format

\end{itemize}
\l plan9 tutorial? shows some use of /dev/draw/?


A few other manual pages concern advanced functionalities
of [[draw]] such as 
the font system (in [[6/font]]),
the mouse (in [[2/mouse]] and [[3/mouse]]), or 
overlapping layers (in [[2/window]]),
but you can read them later.
\n CGPP talks also about windowing system, so graphics system material

%history:
The historical paper~\cite{pike-layers}
describes an ancestor of [[draw]] for the Blit machine.
This article is useful to understand some of the design decisions
presented in this book.
% plan9-in-technicolor.ps? meh.

%Finally, the following web pages describe descendants of [[draw]]:

\chapter{Overview}

%trans: %dup: Assembler.nw
Before showing the source code of [[draw]] in the following chapters, 
%toc: %dup: Assembler.nw
I first give in this chapter an overview 
of the general principles of a graphics system.
%
I also describe quickly the interface of the
files in [[/dev/draw/]], and 
%
show the code of a toy program using functions from [[draw.h]].
%dup: from Assembler.nw
I also define terms, explain how the code is organized, 
and more generally give the background necessary
to understand the code I will show later.


\section{Graphics system principles}

\l image (photo, raster) vs graphics (line drawings, plot, vector)
\l picture vs screen vs monitor vs display
\l graphics card vs graphics adapter vs GPU

%dup: (and extended) introduction/motivations
As said in the introduction, a {\em graphics system}
provides essentially an {API} to {draw} things on a {screen}:
lines, 
rectangles, 
circles, 
characters, etc.
%
The API usually allows also to draw those graphical elements
with different 
{colors},
{widths},
{fonts}, 
{filling patterns},
{orientations},
etc.
\n orientation, hmm, not so much for text in [[draw]]
%
A {\em screen} is composed of thousands of {picture elements}
called {\em pixels}, which can be individually accessed
programmatically.
%
Instead of the screen, the programmer can also draw
first in off-screen {\em images}, and then copy parts of
those images on the screen.
\l in fact screen is usually considered a special image. so in the rest
\l  will use image instead of screen.
\t good to abstract away differences, that screen is just another image

\l FIGURE a screenshot where can see graphic elements?
% genre Facebook page? rectangles, gradiant, circles, images

%toc: ?

%without: ??? no API so direct access? conflicts?

\subsection{Display server}
\n could be in Windows.nw, but useful to explain the /dev/draw/x/

Graphics systems are usually implemented as display servers.
%alt: just lib for old style DOS games? or mirage style?
A {\em display server} is a program that accepts {\em drawing commands}
from multiple {\em clients} via a {\em communication protocol}, 
and then translates those commands into instructions to the graphics card.
%(and changed) intro/motivations  intro/draw  intro/other-system
Designers of graphics systems often used a client/server architecture 
because graphics systems are usually coupled with a windowing system. 
%
In that case, the graphics system needs to serve many clients:
the multiple processes corresponding to the multiple windows on the screen.

%dup: (and changed) intro/motivations  intro/draw  intro/other-system
In most operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows),
the graphics system is {\em strongly} coupled with the {windowing system}.
\l and some windowing systems have network component!
%in-plan9:
However, this does not have to be the case. In fact, in \plan 
you can run a graphical application without any windowing system running.
\l advanced: windows, menus, mouse/keyboard


\subsection{Image resolution}

The {\em resolution} of a screen or {image},
for example, [[640x480x8]], indicates the 
{width} (640), 
{height} (480), and 
{depth} (8) of the image.
\l use 1024x768x16 instead! simpler model! raspberry ftw?
\l resolution def is just the grid? I thought it was also the depth.
%
The {\em width} and {\em height} specify the dimensions of the two-dimensional
array of pixels, also called the {\em grid}.
The {\em depth} represents the number of bits used per pixel.
%
For instance, with a depth of 8 bits, each pixel can take one of 
256 different values.

\l FIGURE where can see gray picture and next to it matrix with values

Pixel values usually encode either a color or a shade of gray
depending on the {monitor}.
%
For the shades of gray, 0 can mean black and 255 white.
In old black-and-white displays, each pixel was using only
one bit: 0 for black and 1 for white. Pictures were then called {\em bitmaps}.
\n Alto introduced bitmapped displays

\subsection{Color representation}

Colors are usually decomposed into three different {\em components}:
red, green, and blue, or {\em RGB} for short.
Note that those colors are {\em primary colors}, meaning that
any color can be expressed as a combination of those three colors.
For instance, yellow is an equal mix of red and green.
\l history is monitor? CRT tubes? the eye system? trichromatic means?

The pixel value of a colored image
can be translated into an actual color by using, for instance,
a {color map}. A {\em color map} associates to a pixel value
between 0 and 255 the three different values for the different RGB components,
for example, 127 for red, 127 for green, and 0 for blue 
(forming a light yellow).

Note that color maps are not necessary. If the resolution of a screen
is for instance [[1024x768x24]], meaning that 24 bits are used
to represent one pixel, then those 24 bits can be decomposed in three
different bytes encoding each one of the RGB components.
The use of 24 bits per pixel, also known as the {\em True Color} format,
is enough to encode 16 million ($2^{24}$) different colors.
\l channels =~ components, but not necessarly colors, pixel value structure
\l FIGURE? src:alok
\l say that arbitrary. can be 24, 16, 32.

\subsection{Raster graphics (pixels)}
\n discrete, digital

The term {\em raster graphics} is often used to talk about graphics
in terms of pixels. 
%
The word {raster} comes from the {\em raster scan} process used in
the cathode ray tubes of old television sets. This process painted an image
line-by-line by illuminating, with three different electron emitters,
thousands of phosphorescent dots triples (one red, one green, one blue)
arranged in a grid.
%
In raster graphics, a programmer sees an image as a two-dimensional array.
\n nice property is that fix amount of memory for any image

The software interface of a graphic card
can be as simple as a reserved area of the memory address space
used to represent the screen as a two-dimensional array.
Such an area is often called the {\em frame buffer}. 
You can then draw on the screen simply by modifying bytes in the frame buffer.
The graphics card then interprets the pixel values in the 
frame buffer to send the appropriate signals to the monitor.
\t only issue is synchro!

The graphics card of the Raspberry Pi machine uses such an interface,
as explained in Appendix~\ref{chap:raspberry-pi-graphic-card}.
When the resolution of the screen is [[1024x768x24]], 
\n actually it's 1024x768x16 by default, but 16 is complicated to explain
the frame buffer requires around 2.2 MB of address space.
If we assume that the frame buffer is {memory-mapped}
at the virtual address [[0xA0000000]], then the simple function 
below can be used to set the color of any pixels on the screen:
\n good to be concrete quickly, to get quickly an idea on how to draw things!

<<function [[set_pixel]](imaginary)>>=
void set_pixel(uint x, uint y, byte red, byte green, byte blue) {
  byte* addr;

  assert(x < 1024);
  assert(y < 768);

  addr = 0xA0000000 + y*1024*3 + x*3;
  *addr = red;
  *(addr+1) = green;
  *(addr+2) = blue;
}
@
\n assume RGB order is byte order, also assume y grows up, also assume kernel
\n  since access directly physical space

\n notion of soft screen and flush vs direct frame buffer but can see later



\subsection{Vector graphics (shapes)}
\n continuous, analog

%trans:
Drawing pictures by modifying individual pixels can be
very tiresome. We would like a more high-level approach.
%
The term {\em vector graphics}, used in opposition
to raster graphics, expresses graphics in terms of
ideal {\em geometric shapes}:
lines, 
rectangles,
circles, 
ellipsis, 
arcs,
Bezier curves,
etc.
%
In vector graphics, a programmer sees
an image as a list of shapes.
%
A shape can be defined by a list of vectors specifying the 
{control points} of a line or a curve.

\n horiz/vert lines, rectangle, arbitrary line, polyline, polygon (fill),
\n ellipse, arc, Bezier

%history:
Note that vector-graphics displays, developed from the oscilloscope
industry, actually predated raster-graphics displays, which
were rooted in the television industry.
\n pike-bitbltd-1984.pdf intro is good to describe early history of graphics
% description of lines, curves?
With time, raster displays became more economical to produce
and more flexible to program, and so are now dominant on the market.

\subsection{Rasterization}

{\em Rasterization} is the process of turning vector graphics, that is 
geometric shapes, into raster graphics, that is pixels on a grid.
Rasterization is a fundamental operation.
\l also valid for 3D? turns a scene in pixels? raycasting is a rasterization?
%
For instance, Figure~\ref{fig:line-raster}
shows the set of pixels resulting from the rasterization
of a line drawn in the [[hellodraw.c]] program
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:getting-started}.
Figure~\ref{fig:line-raster} shows the magnified left part of the screen of 
Figure~\ref{fig:hellodraw}, where you can then see the individual pixels
making up a line.
%
If the resolution of the screen is high enough, and the pixels 
on the monitor small enough,
then the brain can be fooled and can get the illusion that the line
is continuous as in Figure~\ref{fig:hellodraw}.
\n anti-aliasing makes it even better, better illusion, trick the eye more
\l actually just like the thing you read now on paper, it's dots too?
\n Retina display reach physical limite of the eye/retina/brain?
\l ``bitmaps [...] imperfect approximations to the ideal images one
\l  would like to display - Pike-bibltd.pdf

\begin{figure}\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{line-raster}
\end{center}
\caption{Line rasterization.}
\label{fig:line-raster}
\end{figure}
\n From ideal to concrete.

\n if draw not at 45 degree but 32, then no that easy actually :)
% => bresenham algorithm, scanline algorithm.

\subsection{[[bitblt()]] and compositing}
\label{sec:bitblt}

[[bitblt()]]\cite{pike-bitblt}, 
for {\em bit}-boundary {\em bl}ock {\em t}ransfer, is another
fundamental graphic operation.
%
It copies a rectangular area of an image, the {\em source},
to another area of the same or different image, the {\em destination},
while applying for each pixel involved a {\em composition operator} [[op]].
%
The value of a destination pixel [[d]]
is given by the following formula where [[s]] is the value
of a source pixel:

\begin{verbatim}
d <- d op s;
\end{verbatim}

% FIGURE? for transluscence? but then need explain alpha channel?

%history:
The name [[bitblt()]] comes from its use in early graphic systems
where pictures were represented as bitmaps.
%
Programmers are using [[bitblt()]] to highlight regions, 
draw horizontal and vertical lines, draw
rectangles, scroll an image, draw characters, and many more things.
\n see pike-bitbltd-1984.pdf
\l see pictures in "Graphics Smalltalk Kernel" article?
%
In pictures with colors, the [[bitblt()]] primitive can be used
to implement a variety of effects such as translucence by using
the appropriate composition operator.
\n porter-duff

%\subsection{Alpha layer} % and transluscence
\l alpha compositing here? to say how much want from the background?
\l then cite Porter-Duff
% FIGURE with different alpha values?
\l how is rendered a picture with certain alpha value? those are used?
\l or it's used only when compositing? notion of pre-alpha vs post-alpha?

Under \plan, the [[bitblt()]] primitive is called [[draw()]]
and is slightly more general. [[draw()]] is a very generic and
powerful function.
In fact, it is such a versatile procedure that, as we will see later,
it is the building block used by all the other drawing functions;
drawing a line, a polygon, or a circle involves at some
point many internal calls to [[draw()]].
\n actually [[memimagedraw()]]

\l FIGURE Indeed in Figure X a line is a set of horizontal or vertical
% lines which can be set through bitblt.
% same for polygon! fill polygon, scanline.

\l clipping
\l tiling (replicating) when used as a source.

%\subsection{Graphic context}
%alt: used in X11
% but not needed in rio

\subsection{Fonts}
\n fonts illustrate many of the principles we have seen so far, so cool.

%trans:
Geometric shapes are important, but so is {text}, even in a 
graphical-user-interface context.
%
A graphics system can improve over text-based user interfaces
(e.g., terminals) by allowing
the programmer to draw text with different sizes, different styles, and
even different orientations.
\l [[draw]] cant do that though, as opposed to cairo, or can it?
To draw characters, the graphics system requires
a series of pictures defining the shapes of all the characters
of an alphabet. Such a set of pictures is called a {\em font}.

Each character can be represented 
either using vector graphics, as in Figure~\ref{fig:font-vector},
or raster graphics, as in Figure~\ref{fig:font-raster}.
The two approaches illustrate well the pro and cons of the
two picture representations:

\begin{figure}\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{font-m-vector}
\end{center}
\caption{Letter [[m]] defined by a list of shapes.}
\label{fig:font-vector}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{font-a-raster}
\end{center}
\caption{Letter [[a]] defined by a grid of pixels.}
\label{fig:font-raster}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
\item In Figure~\ref{fig:font-vector}, the letter [[m]] is defined
as a set of vectors representing the control points of straight lines
or Bezier curves.
\n also called Outline Font.
{\em TrueType} is a font format\footnote{
Such fonts are stored in files with the [[.ttf]] extension.
}
using this technique.
A character is then just another list of geometric shapes to draw.
\n unify power!
%
This approach is {\em scalable} as one
can {render} the letter in different sizes or orientations by rasterizing
its different elements.
\l hmm scalable missleading? because it is actually slow.
\l actually some issues when scaled down, so some fonts use ``Hinting''
However, such a rasterization can be expensive
to compute, and must be done each time
the program wants to draw a character.
\n in the end it also uses bitblt/draw

\item In Figure~\ref{fig:font-raster}, the letter [[a]] is
defined instead as a bitmap.
This approach supports only one size,
\l or risk of pixelization
but drawing a character can be very fast. Indeed, 
a programmer can just use [[bitblt()]] to copy the rectangle defining
the character on the screen.
\l idea of glyphs put together, kinda template, like printing machine
\l also can be used as cache for vector font

\end{itemize}

Note that \plan uses Unicode for its characters set (and not simply ASCII),
so font files can be large. 
\l Which is why indeed have subfont concept.
\l packard mentioned unicode leads to Xft/fontconfig because it was a mess


%\subsection{Advanced topics}

\l In this book we will cover basic 2D primitives but many adv topics.
\l Or put that in Conclusion? Future directions?

%other topics:
% - Imaging model? Postscript vs PDF? pen-based vs stroke-based?
% - scale/rotate/transform not in this book. But can be library wrapper
%    over library presented here.
% - antialiasing (very simple actually, put light intensity in function of
%    distance to theoritical point on the line (the error))
% - subpixel rendering, leverage position of RGB dots on the screen
% - SEMI True Type fonts, fonts using bezier curves
%    that are vectoriel and so scalable
% - Animation (Core Animation, Flash)
% - 3D. lighting. Shaders. GPU.
%   Not in this book. based on triangles usually. 
% - physical rendering
%   (but already literate programming book on it)


\subsection{Graphical application versus textual application}

% Evidently, output different. text vs graphics (including possibly text).
% But also input different.
% graphics system usually offer also API to access mouse!
% mouse and graphics come together. indeed, mouse is grid input.

% graphics and mouse change how app are programmed. inside out.
% reactive.
% also for keyboard, raw mode. not buffered.
% More on this in Chapter X. First will focus on output. graphics.
% /dev/draw/. Will see later /dev/mouse (and cursor) and /dev/cons 
% and input APIs.

\section{[[/dev/draw/]] filesystem interface}

[[draw]] is a \plan{} device/{filesystem}, not a regular program, 
so its interface
is not a set of command-line arguments and input-output files.
Instead, its primary interface is the files it {serves}.
\l draw is actually many things. one of its interface is draw.h
\n can take some param when bind, but usually empty, just /dev
%
Once you have {installed} [[draw]], usually with the command
[[bind -a '#i' /dev]] (see Section~\ref{sec:getting-started}),
[[draw]] serves a three-levels file tree that provides an interface 
to the graphics facilities of \plan.
\l unioned with other devices
\n 3 levels not that important now, but will be useful later with Q3rd/Q2nd/...
Here is the meaning of the main files and directories managed by [[draw]]:

\l but really could have just a /dev/draw like in 8 1/2 I think.

\begin{itemize}
\l maybe a table instead of a flat list? or a tree :)

\item [[/dev/draw/]] is at the first level and
is the main directory of [[draw]]; almost all the
files of [[draw]] reside under it.
%
As opposed to simpler devices such as
the mouse with [[/dev/mouse]], or the console with [[/dev/cons]],
\n actually there is also /dev/consctl so could be grouped in /dev/cons/ctl
the [[draw]] device uses a directory
because it will manage multiple clients at the same time.
\n will see later that another tech is used later for multiplex /dev/mouse
Because each client is associated with multiple dynamically-created device
files, not grouping those files together under [[/dev/draw/]]
would pollute the [[/dev/]] directory.
%Thus, [[draw]] is more a filesystem than a device file.


\item [[/dev/draw/new]] is at the second level and
is the first file that a graphical application must open.
It allows the opening a new connection to the [[draw]] display server.
%
The function [[initdraw()]], which we will see in Section~\ref{sec:hellodraw_c},
and which is used by all graphical applications,
is using internally this file.
\l why need connection? because there is a state! stored server side!
\l  for each client.

\item [[/dev/draw/1/]], [[/dev/draw/2/]], etc.
are directories corresponding to different connections
to the display server. A process opening [[/dev/draw/new]] will
create a new dynamic subdirectory under [[/dev/draw/]].
%
Those directories will make more sense in the \book{Windows}.
Indeed, the use of the same screen by multiple processes at the same time
is useful mainly in a windowing system context
where independent graphical applications are running concurrently.
\l but only because of the way rio is implemented with efficiency constraint

\item [[/dev/draw/1/ctl]] (and [[/dev/draw/2/ctl]], etc.)
is at the third level
and contains mostly information about the screen, for instance,
its resolution.
Opening [[/dev/draw/new]] returns a file descriptor
that corresponds to a [[/dev/draw/x/ctl]] file, so the programmer
does not need to open this file.
\l a bit magic. Actually can open this file and then have concurrency issues.
\n 12 strings, info on screen, first Image.

\item [[/dev/draw/1/data]] is the file used
by the graphical application to communicate {\em drawing commands}
to the display server. 
%
The format of those drawing commands is pretty regular:
they start all with a single character, for instance, 
[['L']] for drawing a line,
followed by binary parameters\footnote{Multi-byte integer parameters
are transmitted with the low-order byte first.}.
%
The code of all the drawing functions in [[draw.h]] eventually write 
a drawing command in the [[/dev/draw/x/data]] file.
\l protocol
\l can do stuff without API, just by writing in files.

\end{itemize}

The remaining files managed by [[draw]] are listed below;
I will cover them later in this book:

\begin{itemize}

\item [[/dev/draw/1/colormap]] is useful only on 8-bit displays.
I will cover this file in Section~\ref{sec:colormap}.

\item [[/dev/draw/1/refresh]] is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:refresh}.

\item [[/dev/winname]] is at the first level again
and is the only file managed by [[draw]] that is 
not under [[/dev/draw/]].
It is related to the windowing system
and I will cover it in Chapter~\ref{chap:windowing-support}.
\l bootstrap

\end{itemize}

For more information on the [[draw]] files and their
format, I refer you to the documentation of [[draw]]
in [[docs/man/3/draw]].

\n Why is reading plain text out of /dev/mouse and writing plain text
\n to /dev/draw an improvement over how Linux or OS X or Windows does it?
%from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9829662
%   It's very useful because you don't need a C FFI to access OS
%   functionality, graphics libraries and the like. Any language whose
%   implementation allows you to read and write files can already do a lot
%   of things (including GUIs, IPC and so on).
%actually programs uses a C FFI with draw.h, so not a net win.
% maybe one advantage is that it's more transparent.
%alt: maybe Mach MIG is better than "everything is a filesystem" metaphor?

\section{[[hellodraw.c]]}
\label{sec:hellodraw_c}

%trans:
Programs usually do not access directly [[/dev/draw/new]]
or [[/dev/draw/x/data]].
They use instead a higher-level API declared in [[draw.h]].
%rather than writing directly in the device files.
%
The program [[hellodraw.c]] below, which I mentioned
in Section~\ref{sec:getting-started}, and whose graphical output
is Figure~\ref{fig:hellodraw}, uses this API:

<<lib_graphics/libdraw/tests/hellodraw.c>>=
1   #include <u.h>
2   #include <libc.h>
3   #include <draw.h>
4   
5   void main(void) {
6       int result;
7       Image *color;
8       
9       result = initdraw(nil, nil, "Hello Draw");
10      if (result < 0) {
11          exits("Error in initdraw");
12      }
13      
14      color = allocimage(display, Rect(0,0, 1,1), RGB24, true, DMagenta);
15      draw(display->image, display->image->r, color, nil, ZP);
16      
17      line(display->image, 
18           Pt(10, 10), Pt(100, 100), 
19           Endsquare, Endsquare, 10, display->black, ZP);
20      string(display->image, 
21             Pt(200, 200), display->black, ZP, font, 
22             "Hello Graphical World");
23      flushimage(display, true);
24      
25      sleep(5000); // msec
26  }
@
\n use view? no! use display->image directly so simpler. hellorio.c uses view!
\l could introduce a alloccolor?
%ocaml: use exn instead of error code, and return display instead
% of using global (possible because does not use error code for return value)

Here are a few important things to note in this program:

\begin{itemize}

\item [[draw.h]], included at Line~3, contains all
the public data structures and drawing functions of [[draw]].
%
[[libc.h]], included at Line~2, defines
the functions of the \plan core C library.

\item [[initdraw()]], called at Line~9, must be the first
call to the [[draw]] API. It initializes necessary globals
such as [[display]] (used later at Line~14),
%, 15, 17, etc.
which contains information about the screen. 
[[initdraw()]] internally opens [[/dev/draw/new]]
to open a new connection to the display server.
\l and get screen information from /dev/draw/x/ctl
%
It also sets the global [[font]] (used later at Line~21)
to the default font of the system.


\item Lines~7 and 14 illustrate an important concept in [[draw]]:
{\em everything is an image}. Indeed, the [[Image]] type from [[draw.h]]
unifies many things: the screen is represented as an
image in [[display->image]]; fonts are images;
windows, as we will see later, are images; even colors are images.
%
A color is simply a
[[1x1]] image 
(see the second argument of [[allocimage()]], Line~14, which creates a 
rectangle with [[Rect(0,0,1,1)]])
with the {\em replicating} bit set to true 
(the fourth argument of [[allocimage()]]), 
and where all pixels have a fixed RGB value (here [[DMagenta]],
the last argument of [[allocimage()]]).
\l RGBA32?

\item Line~15 uses the very general [[draw()]] function
that I mentioned before in Section~\ref{sec:bitblt}.
It copies the {source} image [[color]] (a replicated [[1x1]] image)
to the {destination} image [[display->image]] (the screen) over
the whole screen rectangle ([[display->image->r]]).
\l mask but here nil. ZP is Zero point so Pt(0,0)

\item 
Line~17 draws on the screen a black line of width 10 in diagonal.
Line~20 draws some text in the font specified by
the global [[font]], which was set previously by [[initdraw()]].

\item Line~23 {\em flushes} the {\em drawing commands buffer} by writing
all the previous commands in [[/dev/draw/x/data]].
Line~23 also instructs the [[draw]] server to make the result 
visible on the screen with the second parameter
of [[flushimage()]].
\l we will see more about that later.

\end{itemize}

%toc:
The following chapters will clarify the code of [[hellodraw.c]],
especially the meaning of the different parameters of the different
functions of [[draw.h]].
%
The goal here was just to give a quick idea on how to use [[draw.h]].

\l stateless API
%alt: different model is Context/State of X11, Postscript, cairo, openGL,
% canvas?

%real-world:
% no need Expose | MappingNotify | ... events, just draw!

See Appendix~\ref{chap:examples} for more examples of graphical
applications using [[draw.h]].

% Dont handle input at all here (mouse, keyboard), or resize event.
% graphical app needs to do that too normally, but simpler for now
% to just show the code to draw.
% There is also an event vs thread programming model for graphical applications.

\l education purpose, program below show how to draw a line
\l without using draw.h but accessing directly the devices.
\l hellorawdraw.c without draw.h

\l note that can run 'colors' in console outside rio! it just
% use /dev/draw, /dev/mouse, etc!



\section{Code organization}
\label{sec:code-orga}

The code of [[draw]] can be decomposed in multiple components that
correspond to different directories in the \plan repository:

\begin{itemize}

\item [[include/graphics/draw.h]] contains the visible part of [[draw]]
for the programmer. This header file contains the
data structures (e.g., [[Image]]) and 
function declarations (e.g., [[draw()]], [[line()]], or [[string()]])
to draw different shapes on the screen.
\n I reference only entities used in hellodraw.c

\item [[lib_graphics/libdraw/]] is a user-space library implementing
the functions defined in [[draw.h]]. However, those functions are just
thin wrappers that write into [[/dev/draw/x/data]] to delegate
the actual rendering to code in the kernel.
%real-world: called libdrm for Linux; hide ioctls behind nice C API.

%defont.c: lucm/latin1.9, in uncompressed form
%readcolmap.c: dead? used in apps?
%misc.c: old image format. delete? used by font still? utilities to convert?


\item [[kernel/devices/screen/]] contains the kernel code
that implements the [[draw]] filesystem, as well as a few device
drivers for graphics cards. 
%
The [[devdraw.c]] file, in particular, contains the different
filesystem methods (e.g., [[drawopen()]], [[drawread()]], or [[drawwrite()]])
\l device/filesystem methods
that will be executed when a program accesses files from [[/dev/draw/]].
\l [[screen.h]]
%
As we will see in Section~\ref{sec:drawwrite-drawmesg},
the [[drawwrite()]] method calls [[drawmesg()]] when
the file involved is a [[/dev/draw/x/data]] file.
[[drawmesg()]] is a large function that
processes all incoming drawing commands in
a giant [[switch()]]. This function looks at the first letter of
the drawing command to decide which graphic operation to perform.

% pool.c?: imagmem! image data store! (in kernel :( X11 spirit )
% screen.c: factorize stuff, gscreen, soft cursor, cursor, graphic text mode
%  (I created it as a model of the one in bcm/)
% vgascreen.c: implem of screen.h hardware specific hooks needed by devdraw
%  and memdraw
% devvga.c: /dev/vga ctl files for vgascreen global parameters?

\item [[lib_graphics/libmemdraw/]] is a library
used by the kernel that contains most of the 
generic graphics-related code. [[drawmesg()]] calls mostly functions
from [[libmemdraw/]] (e.g., [[memimagedraw()]], [[memimageline()]]).
Most of those functions operate on the [[Memimage]] type defined
in [[include/graphics/internals/memdraw.h]].
\l why not directly use memdraw.h? why need all this mess?
% drawmesg() dispatcher to libmemdraw operations and libmemlayer operations
% should also have actual calls to screen.h implem, e.g., vgascreen.c!

% libmemdraw actually does the drawing stuff in memory
% (and rely on some kernel vga functions to do the rest and transfer
%  images from memory to the actual screen (or nop if frame buffer))
% it also rely on some code in libmemlayer.

%replmul.c: replmul global used in mktables to duplicate bits
%defont.c: getmemdefont, used only for graphical text mode
%string.c: seems used only for graphical text mode, simple code at least
% drawchar() is actually in devvga.c
%cruft.c: default implem if link directly with memdraw outside kernel.
% otherwise the linker will complain if no hwdraw() function.
% But normally hwdraw() should be a bridge to screen.h interface 
% functions? (implemented by vgascreen)


\item [[lib_graphics/libmemlayer/]] is another library used
by the kernel to manage overlapping layers. I will cover it
later in Chapter~\ref{chap:overlapping-windows}.
% It's not really layer in the cairo sense. It's really windows.
% Then you can easily implement a windowing system with 
% overlapping pictures (windows) that actually can get exposed back.

%\item [[kernel/devices/screen/386/]]
% specific drivers. Important is interface to provide access to the screen
%  Memimage/Memdata.

%\item [[kernel/devices/screen/user/]]
% user-space utilities for VGA, see appendix X?
% could get rid of it? Does not need that for Raspberry.

%\item [[lib_graphics/libimg/]]

\end{itemize}

%dup: (but changed a lot) from Assembler.nw
Table~\ref{tab:code-orga} presents short descriptions
of the source files used by [[draw]]. I organized
those files according to the directories I mentioned above,
except for the files in [[lib_graphics/libmemlayer/]],
which I will cover in Chapter~\ref{chap:overlapping-windows}.
\t explain that put together in one line
\t  because of the way draw is architectured they are strongly related.
\l lofs of files have similar name in libdraw/ and libmemdraw/.
\l also many .h are really in include/graphics but put with associated dir.
%
The table also shows
the main entities (e.g., structures, functions, globals) the files define
and the corresponding chapter in this document in which the code
contained in a file is primarily discussed.

\t  related to that. maybe can even split libdraw/window.c in rio.c

\l could move menuhit.c and getrect.c out of draw/ in a ui/
%ocaml: more split of draw/ with input/ (keyboard.c, mouse.c) 
% and ui/ (getrect.c, menuhit.c) and geometry/ (arith.c)

% normally apps must link just with libdraw.a, and not libmemdraw.a
% (or libmemlayer.a). 
% There are some apps that use memdraw/memlayer too though
%  to implement a windowing like system inside the app, e.g., acme.
% Only the kernel (and test programs) link with libmemdraw.a normally.
% can actually divide libdraw in two, have a libcoredraw (or libgeometry)
%  so the kernel would not even depend on libdraw.

\n libdraw/ was split in many small files originally. See the comment below.
% The rectclip() function was originally in his own rectclip.c file instead of
% with replclipr.c. In the same way, getdefont() was in his own file
% instead of with defont.c. Note that the kernel needs only rectclip(),
% not rectclipr(). It needs only defontdata and not getdefont(). But
% by putting those functions in bigger files, the linker is then forced
% to link the whole object file and its further dependencies. In
% the case of getdefont(), this generates in the end a signature conflict
% in lockdisplay() because of the differences between QLock (used in Display
% in draw.h) between libc.h and the kernel. For rectclipr() this forced
% to link bufimage() which was in init.c with lockdisplay and so would
% generate the same error (I now put bufimage in another file so
% I can put rectclip() with replclipr()).
% So merging many functions in one single file is actually tricky.
% All of this could be avoided by having a geometry.h and libgeometry.a
% and by having the kernel linking with only libgeometry.a, not libdraw.a.

\section{Software architecture}

From the programmer's point of view, [[draw]] is just a library.
\n not a program you execute like [[5a]] or [[5l]]
%dup: overview/code-orga
Its software architecture is first a flat list of
functions you can call (e.g., [[line()]], [[string()]]),
and data structures you can use (e.g., [[Image]]),
to draw things on a screen.
%dup: overview/interface  overview/helloworld.c  overview/code-orga
All those entities are declared in [[draw.h]].
%
Those are the {\em entry points} of [[draw]].
%
However, what is under those entry points is rather complicated.
Indeed, as you have seen in Section~\ref{sec:code-orga},
[[draw]] has many {components}:
\begin{itemize}

\item A user-space library ([[libdraw]])

\item Two kernel-space libraries ([[libmemdraw]] and [[libmemlayer]])

\item A filesystem (accessible though [[/dev/draw/]], thanks mainly
to [[devdraw.c]])

\item A protocol (for user-space programs to communicate with
the kernel via a [[/dev/draw/x/data]] device file)

\item A few device drivers (for different graphics cards)

\end{itemize}
\l Could this be skipped if reader interested only in core ideas?

%toc:
A good way to see how those components work together is to
{\em trace} a call to one of the functions of the [[draw]] API
through those different components.

\caption{Tracing of [[line()]] through the [[draw]] components.}
\label{fig:soft-archi-directories}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-directories} illustrates a trace of
a call to [[line()]].
%
This trace starts at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-directories}
with the call to [[line()]] in the program [[hellodraw.c]] that you saw
in Section~\ref{sec:hellodraw_c}. I will now go gradually
downwards in Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-directories} to explain the trace:


\begin{enumerate}

\item [[line()]] is {declared} in [[draw.h]].
Its slightly simplified prototype is given below:
\begin{verbatim}
void line(Image* dst, Point p0, Point p1, ..., 
          int width, Image* color, ...);
\end{verbatim}
\l or better to keep things simpler for now?

\item [[line()]] is {defined} in [[libdraw/]].
%dup: (changed) overview/code-orga
However, as I said in Section~\ref{sec:code-orga}, [[libdraw]] is just a 
thin wrapper that delegates most of the work to the kernel. 
The code of [[line()]] just writes a {\em drawing command} 
(starting with the letter [['L']]) in the file descriptor [[Display.fd]]
of the global [[display]].
\n actually this is done in flushimage, but too subtle for now.
%
Remember that this global has been set
previously by a call to [[initdraw()]], as we saw in
Section~\ref{sec:hellodraw_c}.
\l form of RPC. a la thrift.

\item [[display->fd]], as we will see in Chapter~\ref{chap:core-ds},
is a file descriptor that corresponds to a [[/dev/draw/x/data]] device file.
This device file is the primary interface between 
a graphical application and the graphics code in the kernel.

\item The call to [[write()]] in [[libdraw/line.c]] is
a {\em system call}. It triggers a {\em software interrupt}
that jumps to code in the kernel.
%
This software interrupt is handled by
the {system-call dispatcher} in [[kernel/syscalls/]].
%
For more information on how system calls work,
I refer you to the \book{Kernel}.

\item The system-call dispatcher calls [[syswrite()]] 
in [[kernel/files/]] because the original system call was [[write()]].

\item [[syswrite()]] dispatches to the appropriate {\em filesystem method}.
Because the argument to [[write()]] is a file descriptor corresponding
to a file under [[/dev/draw/]], [[syswrite()]] calls the
[[drawwrite()]] method in [[kernel/devices/screen/devdraw.c]].
%
Again, I refer you to the \book{Kernel} to understand how
filesystems work.

\item [[drawwrite()]] calls [[drawmesg()]] because
the file descriptor corresponds to a [[/dev/draw/x/data]]
device file.

\item [[drawmesg()]] is the kernel function that handles
all the drawing commands written in [[/dev/draw/x/data]].
Because the first letter of the command is [['L']], 
[[drawmesg()]] calls the [[memline()]] function.

\item [[memline()]] is a function from the [[libmemlayer]]
library. This library, which I will describe in 
Chapter~\ref{chap:overlapping-windows},
handles images that are overlapping layers.
The important thing for now
is that [[memline()]] eventually calls [[memimageline()]].

\item [[memimageline()]] is a function from the [[libmemdraw]]
library. Its sligtly simplified prototype is given below:

\begin{verbatim}
void memimageline(Memimage *dst, Point p0, Point p1, ..., 
                   int radius, Memimage *color, ...);
\end{verbatim}
\t it is actually _memimageline for now, rename it!
\l explain Memimage vs Image? or say will explain soon.

[[memimageline()]] contains the algorithm to draw lines in 
images in memory. Those images have the type [[Memimage]].
As we will see in Section~\ref{sec:data-struct-relationshops}, 
one of those images
corresponds to the framebuffer; changing bytes
in this image translates to changes on the screen.

\end{enumerate}
\l device driver?

[[memimageline()]] then returns to the caller
[[memline()]], which does the same.
Eventually, the whole call stack is popped,
leading back to code in [[hellodraw.c]].


\l This was complicated ... Why not get line() call directly memimageline?
%  could, but will still need a system call to transfer computed 
%  pictures from user-space to the framebuffer (but there will be no
%  need for drawing commands and the protocol though). Would need a Xrender.

\l about protocol/RPC vs frame buffer.
% design goal was like X11, to be remote! can log on another
% machine, execute program there that actually display on your screen.
% for plan9 they just reuse 9p! network file system so /dev/draw
% can be on the network!
% but this design imply it can not be a frame buffer! The frame buffer
% may not be on the machine the program is running!
% so need send drawing commands, like in X11, because can't allow to send
% all pixels each time through big write on /dev/draw over the network
% (hmm actually with high-speed network maybe we could)

%trans:
Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-directories} focused on the functions
and the control flow of [[draw]]. However, the control flow
is only one part of the story. A few questions are remaining:
%
How are images represented in memory? 
What is the difference between an [[Image]] and a [[Memimage]]?
Where do images reside in memory? In user space? In kernel space? 
How can the frame buffer, usually a protected area of memory, be modified
by user-space programs? 
%
To answer those questions, Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-data}
focuses on the data structures of [[draw]], as well as their relationships.
\n the data flow this time
%
This time, I will go from the top and bottom of 
Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-data} towards its center.


At the top of Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-data} is the
global [[display]] I mentioned a few times before.
%
Its type is the structure [[Display]] defined in [[draw.h]].
In Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-directories}, you saw the use
of [[display->fd]] to write drawing commands in [[/dev/draw/x/data]].
Another important field of [[display]] is [[display->image]], which, as
I said in Section~\ref{sec:hellodraw_c}, {\em represents} the screen.
%
The type of [[display->image]] is the structure [[Image]],
also defined in [[draw.h]]. The global [[display]]
and [[display->image]] are both initialized by [[initdraw()]].


An [[Image]] has three important fields:
\begin{itemize}

\item An {identifier} ([[Image.id]])

\item A {rectangle} ([[Image.r]])

\item An {image format} (called [[Image.chan]]
because it is made of a set of  {\em channels}, 
which I will define in Section~\ref{sec:channels})

\end{itemize}

The last two fields together specify the {resolution} of the image.
%
The first field provides the mean for user-space programs to
{reference} data in the kernel. Indeed, an [[Image]] identifier is nothing more
than a {\em handle} to the real image (of type [[Memimage]])
that resides in kernel space.
%
The identifier is what is transmitted through [[/dev/draw/x/data]].
The call to [[line(display->image, ...)]] in Section~\ref{sec:hellodraw_c}
eventually writes [['L']] (a character), and the identifier
for the screen image [[1]] (an integer) in [[/dev/draw/x/data]].
Identifiers allow programs to tell on which image to 
apply the drawing command.

The first [[Image]] allocated by [[initdraw()]] has always
the identifier [[1]], and always corresponds to the screen.
A program can allocate more off-screen images, for instance
with [[allocimage()]], as shown in Section~\ref{sec:hellodraw_c}.
As we will see in Chapter~\ref{chap:images}, calls to [[allocimage()]]
lead to memory allocations both in user space (for [[Image]])
and kernel space (for [[Memimage]] and the data containing
all the pixels).


%trans:
The kernel-space side of Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-data},
at the bottom, is a bit more complicated than the user-space side.
%
At the very bottom, the kernel global [[sdraw]]
\n sdraw probably because static variable
keeps track of the set of clients the [[draw]] display server
serves.
%dup: (but changed) overview/files-interface
In the examples of this book, the display server will serve mostly a single
client. In the \book{Windows}, it will serve many clients: one
per window, and one for the windowing system program itself.
\n actually not one per terminal window
%dup: (but changed) overview/files-interface overview/hellodraw
In any case, each graphical application must first call [[initdraw()]],
which, by opening [[/dev/draw/new]], opens a new connexion
to the display server. Each connexion adds a new entry in
[[sdraw.clients]], which is an array of pointers to [[Client]],
a structure defined in [[devdraw.h]].
\l kernel header file

Each [[Client]] has an integer identifier that corresponds to
one of the [[/dev/draw/x/]] subdirectory.
%
Moreover, the field [[Client.dimage]] contains a 
set of [[Dimage]] (for [[Draw]] image), a structure also defined 
in [[devdraw.h]].

A [[DImage]] mirrors in kernel space part of an [[Image]] 
that resides in user-space.
The [[Dimage]] and associated [[Image]]
share the same identifier. However, a [[DImage]] also maps
an image identifier to a [[Memimage]], a structured defined
in [[memdraw.h]]. 

A [[Memimage]] is similar to an [[Image]];
they have similar fields ([[r]] and [[chan]]). An important
difference is that the new field [[Memimage.data]] points
to an area in kernel space where resides the actual pixels
of the image.
This area can be either the framebuffer (shortened [[FB]] in
Figure~\ref{fig:soft-archi-data}) or an off-screen image
allocated from the {\em memory pool} [[imagmem]]
(see the \book{Kernel} and the \book{Libcore} for
more information on memory pools).
\l (or soft screen and flush hook)
The [[Memimage]] representing the screen is also stored
in the global [[drawscreen]].
\l important global we will see in the following chapter.
\n skip Memdata for now, already quite complicated.
\l Many intermediate because sharing. will see later.



% --------------------------------

% Memdraw is core algo. Used by kernel. Wrapped by kernel
% in some Dxxx (e.g., DImage). Memlayer is overlay on memdraw
% to handle overlapping windows and backstore. Kernel use memdraw. 
% User uses libdraw
% which just marshall and have id references mimicking
% stuff in memdraw hold in the kernel.

% id (for image, desktop, etc) is key. pass id instead of whole structure.

% draw() rectangle is fundamental! all other shapes are in term of draw().


% maybe can also show the simplest interface, a frame buffer, and
% how /dev/draw build on top of that? In theory could have
% just a frame buffer and libmemdraw/ on top of it.

% = frame buffer or vga =
% = screen.h and gscreen Memimage =
% = libmemdraw/ =
%
% = libmemlayer/ =
% = draw device =
% = libdraw/ =
% = app =

% app, library, kernel draw server, kernel draw libs, vga driver
% kernel vs libs vs apps (vs rio)

% public API -> marshaller -> flush -> KERNEL -> unmarshaller -> algorithm
% some kind of RPC and protocol

% libdraw -> KERNEL -> devdraw -> libmemdraw | libmemlayer -> devvga -> clgd5446
% that's a lot of entities

% xxx, doxxx, memxxx, memlxxx, drawxxx, screenxxx

% Display (User side, dirno) Client (Kernel side, vga structure) 
%  Image (User side, id) MemImage (Kernel side, id -> full structure) DImage
%   can draw on that (lines, rectangles, lines, ellipses, text, etc)
%  Screen
%   Window (Image)

% devvga
%  why imagmem? why imagmem and mainmem? why not use other allocator?
%  see screen/user/notes.txt especially about the old way to get graphics on PC

% data structures archi:
%  Display|Image|display -> Client|MemImage|screen 
%    -> gscreen -> gscreendata.bdata and vgascreen.paddr?
% interface archi:
%  API -> marshall -> unmarshall 
%   -> algorithm libmemdraw (and libmemlayer sometimes)
%   -> screen.h interface (mostly flush image)
%   -> vgascr interface -> vgadev interface
%   -> actual hardware special operations


% read/load cload/cread
% unload/write
% ???

% what is the minimum we ask from hardware? just a screen.h interface?
% with a not too bad flushmemscreen? if look at screen.c for raspberry,
% most of screen.c is hardware independent (arrow picture, software cursor, 
% gscreen, window, curpos). The only hardware dependent is fbinit to
% initialize frame buffer. hwdraw() does nothing. flushmemscreen() does
% nothing. They just need a gscreen->bdata to point to a frame buffer
% and set the property of this memimage depending on the hardware
% (width, depth, chan). That's it!


%alt: a stateful API.
% The API of draw stateless, as opposed to ocamlgraphics/cairo/X11/...
% where you move the cursor and then ask to draw stuff. In those systems
% you have a context. Here you specify everything each time.

\section{Book structure}

%trans: %dup: (and adapted) from Assembler.nw
You now have enough background to understand the source code of [[draw]].
%toc:
The rest of the book is organized as follows.
%
I will start by describing the core data structures of [[draw]]
in Chapter~\ref{chap:core-ds}.
%
Then, in Chapter~\ref{chap:init}, I will explain
how [[draw]] is initialized, both on the kernel side,
where the graphics card needs to be configured for a particular
resolution, and on the user side, where client applications
need to connect to the display server.
%
Chapter~\ref{chap:user-kernel-bridge} will focus on the bridge
between the user and the kernel. I will explain how
client applications communicate with the display server.

The following chapters will describe the different
functions of the [[draw]] API: 
Chapter~\ref{chap:images} the functions to allocate images
(e.g. [[allocimage()]]), 
Chapter~\ref{chap:draw} the central function [[draw()]] to manipulate
rectangles, 
Chapter~\ref{chap:drawing-shapes} the functions to draw shapes
(e.g. [[line()]]),
\l rely on draw
Chapter~\ref{chap:fonts} the functions to draw text
(e.g. [[string()]],
\l rely also on draw
and finally Chapter~\ref{chap:image-io} the functions to load and save images 
(e.g. [[loadimage()]]).
\l Image IO not draw, not vector but raster, pixel directly.

In Chapter~\ref{chap:input}, I will describe the functions of [[draw]]
that programs can use to interact with input devices, especially the mouse.
The mouse is the primary device used in graphical applications,
and its use leads to the animation of some graphics on the screen: 
the {mouse cursor}.
\n not in draw.h, in mouse.h and keyboard.h, but code is in libdraw/

Chapter~\ref{chap:overlapping-windows} and Chapter~\ref{chap:windowing-support}
will present a major image extension: overlapping layers.
They are one of the building blocks to implement a windowing system,
but they can also be used in regular applications
(e.g., the \plan editor [[acme]]).

Some of the code in Chapter~\ref{chap:images} through
\ref{chap:image-io} will be simplified to show
only the parts of the code that handle 32-bits images.
However, a real graphics system must support different image formats:
24-bits, 16-bits, 8 bits, images using color maps, or
even bitmaps. A graphics system must be able to copy the
pixels from one image using one format, to another image
using an entirely different format. I will cover
all those cases in Chapter~\ref{chap:non-true-color}.
% 
Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced} presents other
features of [[draw]] which I did not show 
before to simplify the explanations, for instance,
the support for Bezier curves, or optimizations in 
certain drawing functions.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} concludes
and gives pointers to other books in the \principia series.

%toc: %dup: (adapted) Assembler.nw
Some appendices present the code of non-functional properties:
code to help debug [[draw]] in Appendix~\ref{chap:debugging-appendix}, 
and code to manage errors in Appendix~\ref{chap:error}.
%
Appendix~\ref{chap:math} contains the code of generic
mathematic functions used by [[draw]], but which are
not unique to [[draw]].
\l hmm actually a bit specific
%
Appendix~\ref{chap:raspberry-pi-graphic-card} and \ref{chap:pc-vga-driver}
will present the code for the device drivers of two traditional graphics cards.
%
Finally, Appendix~\ref{chap:examples} contains more examples of
graphical applications to get a better feel of how to use [[draw]]
in practice.

%toc:
In this chapter, I will present the most important data structures of [[draw]].
Most of them are defined in [[draw.h]]; the others are defined in the kernel,
but they relate to structures from [[draw.h]].
For instance, [[Client]], which is defined in [[devdraw.c]],
is the kernel equivalent of [[Display]], which is defined in [[draw.h]].
\l also memdraw.h

\n many important globals are in libdraw/globals.c
\l hmm, lots of DS to present.

\n many section titles mimic the section of overview/principles, which is good

\section{Geometry}
\n put early cos many API mention Point and Rectangle, so core DS

%trans: before image, display, basics! geometry!

% screen is by convention growing right and down. (0,0), (640,480),
% so (0,0) is top left.
%alt: see already that lack of float is annoying; in codemap I can map
%  this to a virtual (0,0), (1,1) in float!
%alt: why not like math 0,0 is at lower left?

% FIGURE! with screen, point and rectangle

% see addpt(2)
% http://blog.golang.org/go-image-package

\subsection{[[Point]]}

<<struct [[Point]]>>=

@
% int! they are pixels! (good and bad, anyway can be building block for more)
\l RasterOp model. opposed to Postscript imaging model?
%alt: %real-world: floats as in cairo
% more device-independent, let computer do the math to adapt to screen.
% Big deal. but can have wrapper library.
%device-coordinate (or screen-coordinate) vs world-coordinate

%ctor

Point
Pt(int x, int y)
{

@
%ocaml: ocaml does not require some copy here. can return "shared value".
%c: no allocation so convenient. No malloc/free needed.

<<function [[eqpt]]>>=
bool
eqpt(Point p, Point q)
{

@
%ocaml: builtin = does that


<<global [[ZP]]>>=

<<type [[Vector]]>>=
typedef Point Vector;
@
%pad: I introduced that
% could also have a Size as most Vectors are used to represent a size
% (a width and height)
\t use more that! leads to clearer code I think

% arithmetic on points

<<function [[addpt]]>>=
Point
addpt(Point a, Point b)
{
    a.x += b.x;
    a.y += b.y;

% use simply pervasives min and max

% how can have one but not the other?
% FIGURE where at center point p1, and then p1 can be 4 different places
%  (higher/before, higher/after, lower/before, lower/after)

% ex of use in Windows.nw: r = canonrect(Rpt(p0, p));

\section{[[Display]] (and [[Client]])}
% and [[display]]

%trans: saw in overview chapter, /dev/draw files, and client/server archi.
% need client and server DS. 
%clients have Server and server has Client.

% Display server.

% connection to device, and client handler!
% initdraw()

\subsection{[[Display]] and [[display]]}

% user side, can see it as essentially a connection handler,
% most things in plan9 done via files! including drawing!
<<struct [[Display]]>>=

{
    // ref_own<Image>, the full screen
    Image   *image;

    <<[[Display]] devdraw connection fields>>

    <<[[Display]] basic images fields>>
    <<[[Display]] font fields>>
    <<[[Display]] other fields>>

    // Extra
    <<[[Display]] concurrency fields>>
};
@
% ctor = initdisplay <- initdraw, shown later
%dead:
% bool	local;
% ulong	dataqid;

% we will see Image later.

% rename image field to screen/view? is it the same than global screen/view?
% NO! it's not the same. it's the whole screen here.
% actually even when run under rio you can draw on the rest :( ugly.
\t rename to screen!! now that I have cleaned up screen-name issues
\t  by using instead view and desktop (still todo last part)


% why not just a fd to device file? because complex device, device
% directory actually. and buffer. and protocol! and other stuff we
% want to hide.

% mostly Image and buffer with command to be flushed to device.


%!!!!
<<global [[display]]>>=
// option<Display>
Display	*display;
@
%ocaml: return value instead of using global? why need global?
% can pass display to the line/draw/ellipse/... through Image.display
% so not really need a global!

% <> = ... <- initdraw
% Could be returned instead? So API would be opendisplay()?
% Easier that way? no need to pass it everywhere?
% But anyway it's true that when use Image there is anyway a ref
% to Display so maybe it could be returned; after all closedisplay()
% takes it as a parameter.
% But global because initdraw actually sets more than one global, so
% if was opendisplay it would need to return a 4-uple
% (display, screen, view, font)

% can have multiple displays? probably so one program
% can draw to multiple screens :)


% so code for most of this book could use directly
%  display->image but we will see later better use view
%  which handles both when run under rio or not.



<<[[Display]] devdraw connection fields>>=

\t mv windir out of it? 
\l useful? anyway it's always /dev


% usually have draw(dstimg, rectangle, srcimg, maskimg)

\section{[[Image]] (and [[Memimage]])}
% and [[screen/view]],  and DImage?

% Images in plan9 draw are specials! (see plan9-in-technicolor.ps!)
% used for many things. Screen, off-screen (temp) images, 
% colors, fonts, masks, etc.
% even windows!

% unify on-screen and offscreen data

%real-world: called pixmap in Twin, probably X11, and more.

\subsection{[[Image]]}
% and [[view]]

% Display.image! here is Image.
% The screen is an image (id = 0).

<<struct [[Image]]>>=
struct Image
{
    int         id;     /* id of system-held Image */

    Rectangle   r;      /* rectangle in data area, local coords */

    channels        chan; // image format
    // derives from Image.chan
    int         depth;      /* number of bits per pixel */

    Rectangle   clipr;  /* clipping region */
    bool        repl;   /* flag: data replicates to tile clipr */

    Display     *display;   /* display holding data */

    <<[[Image]] layer fields>>

    // Extra
    <<[[Image]] extra fields>>
};
@
%ocaml: mutual recursive type between Image and Display

% ctor = allocimage (doing some RPC)

% will see chan, the image format later (basically how many bytes
% per colors and in which order, e.g., rgba32)

% display + id => can communicate to kernel what we are talking about.
%  need Display pointer because when do draw operation we need
%  to write in img->display.buf! and then flushimage(img->display)!
%  we need the connection handler! (but could use global ...)

% Just need to pass id to kernel! no need to pass all pixels, and info.
% In fact most of the fields above are duplicate of in kernel DS.

%alt: here no data! just id. alternative models?
%real-world: cairo? no client/server for most images, just pointer
% and many functions over pointer.

% read from /dev/draw/new initially when open the connection
%  see initdisplay() 
% system-held id! usually 0 for the first image of /dev/draw/new
%  for the frame buffer.
% incremented then at each allocimage, thx to Display.imageid field

% Rectangle r. Most of the time starts at 0,0 if full screen but can have
% other format. 
% Why need that? not sure you need really.
% When have windows, get actually a sub rectangle of the full image
% and share internally the same data.
% (but actually can have logical coord then and starts at 0, 0)
% Or when to separate your drawing algo in different parts, you
% can allocate different image for different parts with as a rectangle
% the final destination. Then you can just copy those images on
% the screen and use its rectangle as the dst. But could do without I think.
% Can have multiple rectangles over same shared big image.
% (but could use clipr)


% diff between .r and .clipr? use .r to do stuff like
%  draw_line(10 + r.min.x, 20 + r.min.y, ...). A bit tedious.
%  would be better to abstract this for clients.
% For most images used as source or masks or colors it is 
%  simply Rect(0, 0, width, height)
\l and clipr? maybe could delay its introduction

% clipping notion!! 
% repl notion!! from draw(2):
%  "A boolean value specifying whether the image is tiled to cover
%  the plane when used as a source for a drawing operation."
% chan notion!!
%  alpha notion!!
%  depth notion!

% for r, clipr, repl, see plan9-in-technicolor.ps!
%/* huge but not infinite, so various offsets will leave it huge, not overflow*/
% clipr = Rect(-0x3FFFFFFF, -0x3FFFFFFF, 0x3FFFFFFF, 0x3FFFFFFF);


% Image.display is of Display->image? not necessaraly I think, only
% the main image (screen) is.


\l typedef int imageid;? screenid? windowid?
% hmm but for imageid actually on user side we return Image* not imageid
% so this imageid typedef will be really internal to libdraw

<<[[Display]] other fields>>=
// gensym
int     imageid;
@
% counter, incremented each allocimage(), rename imageidcnt?
% why need that client side? id allocation is handled in kernel no?
% apparently not, kernel actually just check that passed id is indeed
% unused (in Client DImage hash).

% views of the same Memdata (e.g., the screen). Efficient. No copy.
% This is why also have Rectangle r. Windows will be sub rectangle

%  need mentioned in comment (see imagemove callback)

% the raw pixel data! but to know where to modify you need

\t FIGURE to explain diff between .base and .bdata (and .zero)
% base is poolalloc raw pointer, then at this address 
% - first word is backpointer to Memdata structure, 
% - second word is callerpc for debugging
% - then the actual pixels

% this is kinda a frame buffer. But actually needs one
% operation to transfer from this memory to the actual screen?
% hmm flushmemscreen is responsible for that, but it can be a nope
% when bdata is already pointing to the frame buffer.
% the vga driver does a copy though probably.
% but anyway bdata is not necessaraly for the frame buffer, it can
% be any images the user works on.
% see also ishwimage()

% could put a generic ishwimage here! that just check if 
% i->data->bdata == gscreen->data->bdata!

%this is set in screensize() by VGA driver

% unfortunate that use term "Screen" already used for other stuff.

%[[vga.h]] interface?? vga_screen global?


% This used to be called the [[VGAscr]] section.
% But what matters is not so much VGA but the screen.h interface.
% We actually moved more stuff to a generic screen.c, to be closer
% to the simplicity of bcm/screen.c. We don't want to expose ugly
% VGA details when nowadays things are simpler like the frame buffer
% interface of the raspberry.

% this used to be in vgascreen.c, but every archi was defining
% such a gscreen, so makes sense to factorize in a screen.c.
% there also used to be a vgascreen[0].gscreen (see screensize()), but
% this was redundant then with gscreen.

% Also because need id only when have User/kernel separation.
% Appli could use directly Memimage (and some do).

% Also id might be different in different client but same shared image!

% why D? For Draw Image. Cos have Image, Memimage (memdraw),
% and DImage for kernel stuff. Indeed can use lots of the graphics
% stack independently of the kernel and draw device.

% hence the difference between /new and /ctl.

%\subsection{[[/dev/draw/x/refresh]]}
% adv topics



\section{The drawing commands protocol}

% we will see later in the book repetitive structure
% which correspond to what we call the Draw message protocol.
% Each section below present a step in this protocol.

\subsection{Step 1: API function}

% first API.

% ex line() ...

%real-world: =~ Xlib layer

\subsection{Step 2: marshalling}
% This is also called serializing. 
% (Java says marshalling is serializing the data and the code itself)

% ex line code to marshall with use of BGSHORT, bufimage, etc.


% Lots of boilerplate code, would be better to use thrift in the end?
% Lots of marshalling/unmarshalling boilerplate with BPLONG and so on.
% File interface is nice but limited in the end. Or maybe can just
% write a thrift like tool on top of the file interface that generates
% most of the boilerplate at least.

% G = Get, P = Put
% B = Binary? Bytes? Buffer?

<<function [[BGSHORT]]>>=
#define	BGSHORT(p)		(((p)[0]<<0) | ((p)[1]<<8))
@
<<function [[BGLONG]]>>=
#define	BGLONG(p)		((BGSHORT(p)<<0) | (BGSHORT(p+2)<<16))
@
<<function [[BPSHORT]]>>=
#define	BPSHORT(p, v)		((p)[0]=(v), (p)[1]=((v)>>8))
@
<<function [[BPLONG]]>>=
#define	BPLONG(p, v)		(BPSHORT(p, (v)), BPSHORT(p+2, (v)>>16))
@

% could start by a simple example? like flush?


<<[[Display]] buffer fields>>=
// drawing operations to write in /dev/draw/x/data until flush
// array<byte> (length = Display.bufsize)
byte    *buf;
int     bufsize;
// index in Display.buf array
byte    *bufp;
@
% who sets bufsize? initdisplay, usually set to iounit(datafd).

% when want to write a "message" of size n, get a pointer to the
% next free byte in the buffer
<<function [[bufimage]]>>=
byte*
bufimage(Display *d, int n)
{
    byte *p;

    <<[[bufimage()]] sanity check n>>
    <<[[bufimage()]] flush if buffer full>>
    p = d->bufp;
    d->bufp += n;
    return p;
}
@
%ocaml: use ^ and simply add_buf and string buffer
% instead of those bufimage and manual a+5, a+12, etc.

<<[[bufimage()]] flush if buffer full>>=
if(d->bufp + n  >  d->buf + d->bufsize)
    if(doflush(d) < 0)
        return nil;
@
%ocaml: use exn not nil return

<<[[bufimage()]] sanity check n>>=
if(n < 0 || n > d->bufsize){
    werrstr("bad count in bufimage");
    return nil;
}
@
% werrstr ? Libcore?



% why not _flushimage? because this one we actually write stuff!
% we not just modify buffer. we send it to the device!
<<function [[doflush]]>>=
static
errorneg1
doflush(Display *d)
{
    int n, nn;

    n = d->bufp - d->buf;
    if(n <= 0)
        return OK_1; // warning?

    nn=write(d->fd, d->buf, n);
    <<[[doflush()]] sanity check nn>>
    d->bufp = d->buf;
    return OK_1;
}
@
%ocaml: exn?

% write!! trigger kernel side!

<<[[doflush()]] sanity check nn>>=
if(nn != n){
    <<[[doflush()]] if [[_drawdebug]]>>
    d->bufp = d->buf;	/* might as well; chance of continuing */
    return ERROR_NEG1;
}
@
%ocaml: use exn because anyway many places do not check the return value
% of doflush or flushimage and just ignore if error

% important to reset bufp! otherwise get into a loop

% usually first letter is message kind. e.g., 'a' for alloc
% 'l' for line.
% in total =~ 20 messages?
% compared to 120 messages in X11R4, and in X11R6?

% how communicate error from API call? from kernel?
% By having syscall returning error code when writing in /dev/draw/x/data
% (can then use werrstr to know more about the error)

\subsection{Step 3: unmarshalling and [[drawmesg()]]}
% also called demarshalling, or deserializing

%real-world: =~ Xserver

<<[[drawmesg()]] locals>>=
byte *a;
int m = 0;
char *fmt = nil;
@
% m is for storing how much bytes were read for this message,
% so the loop on the buffer can go on and process the next message

% the big one!! this is in kernel!!
% syswrite -> drawwrite(Qdata) -> <>
<<function [[drawmesg]]>>=
void
drawmesg(Client *client, void *av, int n)
{
    <<[[drawmesg()]] locals>>

    a = av;
    if(waserror()){
        if(fmt) 
            printmesg(fmt, a, false);
        nexterror();
    }
    while((n-=m) > 0){
        USED(fmt);
        a += m;
        // dispatch on first letter of the drawing command
        switch(*a){
        <<[[drawmesg()]] cases>>
        default:
            error("bad draw command");
        }
    }
    poperror();
}
@
%old:    /*  iprint("error: %s\n", up->errstr);  */
%old: I put 'true' to printmesg, but then removed it because
% it is normal that certain calls generate an error like allocscreen.

% split in different messages chunks hence the while.
% the switch will adjust m which contains the size for one message
% (which vary dependong on the message command).

% unmarshallers helpers:
% drawrectangle(), etc


\subsection{Step 4: algorithm}
% Memory Algorithm?

%real-world: libpixman?

\subsection{Step 5 (optional): hardware support hook}

%real-world: libdrm and Linux kernel comm?

% via screen and then VGAscr and then VGAdev interfaces
% (and also VGAcur interface)

%\subsubsection{Screen interface}
% Kernel/Hardware bridge

% screen.h

%\subsubsection{Graphics card}
% Graphic VGA card?
% there is also the VGA interface, which is something different

%\subsubsection{VGA interface}
% or VGA screen? meh maybe, simpler to just have a
% frame buffer
% vga.h







\chapter{Images}
\label{chap:images}

% Fundamental piece!
% The screen is an image. Colors are images!! Mask are images.
% Tiles are images. Background are special images.
% Fonts are images (even Windows are images).

% Can have multiple images, draw there, and at some point
% quickly copy on main image (display->image).

% The initial display->image is actually allocated for you
% (got a first image allocated for you when open draw device, 'screen/view')
% But how allocate new one? temporary canvas to draw on.

% see Image IO later, individual pixels! raster images.

\section{Allocation}

% already one allocated for you! the screen, image id 0.
% view! (was screen)

% allocimage(2)

\subsection{API}

% remember in initdisplay first API calls!
%    disp->white = allocimage(disp, Rect(0, 0, 1, 1), GREY1, true, DWhite);
%    disp->black = allocimage(disp, Rect(0, 0, 1, 1), GREY1, true, DBlack);

\section{Clipping and replicating}
% (tiling)
% part 1

% Clipping is fundamental graphics operation. Very useful
% generic functionality. Like narrow mode in emacs :)
% Useful especially internally when have multiple windows!

% what about non-rectangular clipping? useful?

% Replication is useful to save space in memory, for color, while
% still being general. Also useful for adv effect such as tiling
% (repeating a background pattern for instance).

% Clipping called by many, to optimize things, e.g., no need to flush some modif
% if rectangle outside the clipping area.
% Modify the first parameter when they overlap to match the intersection.


% Can have either repl or clip? Can have both! Usually have
% repl set to true and infinite (actually huge) clipping. This is why in code
% later there is code that first do  rectclip(r, img->clipr)
%  and then if(!(img->flags&Frepl)) rectclip(r, img->r)

% Note that the repl bit is used only when the image is used as a source.
% This is why the clipping code for dst and src is a bit different.


<<[[_allocimage()]] set clipr>>=

    /* huge but not infinite, so various offsets will leave it huge, not overflow */

\chapter{Manipulating Rectangles}
\label{chap:draw}

%\section{[[Point]] and [[Rectangle]]} types in core DS.

% Drawing a "rectangle" is actually a fundamental op. 
% Rectangle can represent an area. Can set/unset/copy/blend 
%  pixels from one area of one  image to another image.
% No need complex algo, horiz and vert lines map well to pixels.
% No need complex shape algorithm, just move all the bytes covering a rectangle.
% In fact it is the basis used by other shape algorithms.

% But operations is actually quite complicated still.

%real-world: the fundamental block of cairo seems to be trapezoids.
% the fundamental block of 3D cards are triangles.

% http://blog.golang.org/go-imagedraw-package is pretty good to
%  explain API and rational (but has just draw(), no line()/ellipsis()/...)

% aka bitblt aka RasterOp

\section{[[draw()]]}

% draw() is fundamental op!
% very flexible.
% normally should be simple but made complicated because of possible
%  complex source, mask, replication, translation, optimisations, 
%  image formats, etc.

% Can have very fancy things done easily (e.g., gradient, tiling, transluscent)
%  but very simple things like drawing a rectangle with one color are
%  forced to use an API a bit more complicated than what it should.

%show toy program and screenshot of the rectangle!
% maybe with very simple draw(dst, Rect(10,10, 20,20), Black, nil, ZR);

%less: put technicolor.ps slides with draw (of actual images like in racket)?
% (meh, technicolors.ps not that good actually)

% see bibio/cs-history/pike84bitblt.pdf, history bitblt() from the Alto
% and Blit. History and implementation. Inventor = Dan Ingalls Diana Merry

% SoverD Source Over Destination, classic
% see plan9-in-technicolor.ps! bitblt and porter-diff compositing algebra

% FIGURE with meaning of p1, r, vs src, mask, and dst.
% r is rectangle in dst (if not it's clipped anyway).
% p1 is point in src (or mask), which where things will start.
% it will correspond to r.min.
% See draw(2) to understand the complex semantic with repl and clipr.

% For very simple cases src is just a color (and so replicated) 
%  and p1 does not really matter.
% Then can do simple case where dst and src starts at 0,0
%  and then can alter a bit r and p1.
% src can also be a tile in which case p1 matters too.

\section{Compositing pixels}

% The general case. Compositing! advanced effects such as transluscent.
% But also advanced shape clipping, tiling, etc.

% also can have multiple "layers" with this tech and do stuff like codemap!
% intermediate surfaces. Like in Photoshop/Gimp. You Compose!

%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing

% Porter/Duff model. Used everywhere (cairo, OpenGL, Quartz, PDF 1.4, etc)
% draw() model actually cited by Keith Packard:
% dest = (source IN mask) OVER dest


% good example: what to draw a char, so have images with raster of
% char, but then black and white. Dont want white to cover! Could
% have convention that white means special, but more general is
% notion of alpha! Dnotacolor (or Dnofill)! fully transparent.
% And then can have different graduation of transparency! powerful!

% for transparency, drop shadows, and I think also for text anti-aliasing
% you need compositing with the old value, and you need that at different
% strength for each pixel and so an alpha channel!

\chapter{Fonts}
\label{chap:fonts}

\l how to draw text in diagonal? can? cairo can.

% fonts are a special kind of pictures 
% (bezier? or raster? raster here but could be bezier)

% Show simple test code showing use of font.
% Maybe just 2 calls to 2 different openfont() and 2 calls to string().
% Also start from last string thanks to the point returned by string.
% Also can call freefont().

% font(6), image(6),
% subfont(2), cachechars(2), 

% related:
%  - toy text API in Cairo 
%    does aliasing! scaling! rotation!
%  - Pango library with GTK (same than cairo but less buggy)
%  - freetype? fontconfig?
%  - openGL? actually one of the missing stuff in openGL is text API I think


%https://engineering.eventbrite.com/its-2015-and-drawing-text-is-still-hard-webgl-threejs/
% 
%http://behdad.org/text/
% State of text rendering in 2012 in Linux
% - fast font rasterizer using GPU in rust:
%   http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2017/02/14/pathfinder/
% - enclyclopedie of fonts, font design: http://luc.devroye.org/fonts.html
% on hinting
%http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/index.html

% super tricky rasterization process of scalable fonts:
% https://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/trtalr.aspx

% can have font with any size? can scale? like in Cairo (and Pango)?
% can do codemap easily? I don't think so.

\t EASY rename f in sf when it involves a subfont, in fields, in locals
\t EASY rename cf to sf_range

% Bitmap font
% True Type font (of Apple originally)
% Clear Type font (subpixel of MS)
% Free Type = open source True Type

% Outline fonts = vector font.
% Hinting information = hacks to adjust glyphs at small pixel sizes
% Advanced topic.

\section{Font files formats}

% show content of unicode.font where see list of subfonts ranges.
%  A subfont is a picture containing many chars! where spec of chars
%   stored after in fontchars.
%  one font is split in many subfonts cos save space cos unicode really 
%   large so would be big images with lots of space wasted.
%   (65000 chars? 8x8 => total size = ?)
% maybe show one subfont file? where see compressed at the top?

% font format: see unicode.font
% - a file (or string) with a list of subfont ranges
% - %d %d\n%d %d\t%s\n...  first 2 numbers are height, ascent, 
%   and then a list of lines with each time
%     min/max (rune range), offset(optional), subfont name
% for offset see latin1.9 font or unicode.font and last unicode chars.

% subfont format (see getdefont): when uncompressed:
%  - ld = format for chan
%  - rectangle of font bits image
%  - data, via loadimage
%  - hdr for fontchars
%  - data for list of fontchars

% why subfont? because Unicode! far bigger than ASCII.

% so bitmap-based font. Not outline-font/true-type fonts. So 
% fixed size, fixed orientation :( no codemap.

\section{Additional data structures}

\subsection{[[Font]] and [[font]]}

<<struct [[Font]]>>=
struct Font
{
    // ref_own<filename>, // e.g., /lib/font/bit/lucm/latin1.9.font
    char        *name;
    // ref<Display>
    Display     *display;

    short       height; /* max height of image, interline spacing */
    short       ascent; /* top of image to baseline */

    <<[[Font]] subfont cache fields>>
    <<[[Font]] character cache fields>>
    <<[[Font]] other fields>>
};
@
% ctor = buildfont <- openfont

\t FIGURE showing relation with height, ascent, etc.
% ascent used in string() to adjust the point where to display text
% so can say string(Pt(10,10)) but in the end it will display at
% Pt(10, 23) because the ascent is 13 and we want the text to be
% below Pt(10,10).

<<global [[font]]>>=
Font	*font;
@
%ocaml: pass it around each time instead? more functional? more tedious?

% used for? convenient shortcut?
% one of the global set by initdraw.


<<[[Display]] font fields>>=
Font    *defaultfont;
@
% used for? diff with global font? set in geninitdraw to same value than font
%  not used that much so perhaps could delay


% loaded fonts (subfonts) will be Images! in fact in Dimage
% there will be font properties inlined.


% Fonts are made of a set of subfonts where one subfont
% contain a big image with a set of chars. Not all cos could
% take too much space. So subfonts loaded as needed.

<<[[Font]] subfont spec fields>>=
// array<ref_own<Cachefont>> (length = Font.nsub)
Cachefont   **sub;  /* as read from file */
short       nsub;   /* number of subfonts */
@
%ocaml: array directly, no need separate nsub
\t rename sub to subspec or sf_spec

% spec of set of subfonts, but not the actual loaded subfont.
<<struct [[Cachefont]]>>=
struct Cachefont
{
    Rune		min;	/* lowest rune value to be taken from subfont */
    Rune		max;	/* highest rune value+1 to be taken from subfont */
    // option<int>, None = 0
    int		offset;	/* position in subfont of character at min */

    // ref_own<string>, relative filename
    char		*name;			/* stored in font */
    // option<ref_own<filename>>, absolute filename, computed by subfontname()
    char		*subfontname;		/* to access subfont */

};
@
% information about a range of chars, but still no Subfont.
\t rename cos it is actually not a cache ... rename SubfontInfo?

% all of that is set in buildfont.

\t How transit from Font to subfont? other fields are Cachexxx
% which have beneath probably a Subfont.

\subsection{[[Subfont]] and [[Fontchar]]}

%cachechars(2):
%"A Subfont is a set of images for a contiguous range of characters,
%stored as a single image with the characters placed side-by-side on a
%common baseline."

<<[[Display]] font fields>>=

@
% used to bootstrap when lookup *default*, but could be done via
% a installsubfont I think instead.

<<struct [[Subfont]]>>=
/*

    <<[[Subfont]] other fields>>

    // Extra
    int		ref;
};
@
%ocaml: no need n, use array which has fast Array.length

% ctor = allocsubfont (<- getdefont | ???)
% uchar so image can not be more than 255 pixels (but can be very wide)

% remember though that Image is just an id. Actual data is in kernel.

% n+1 so can have width of last char

<<struct [[Fontchar]]>>=
struct	Fontchar
{
    // character coordinates in Subfont.bits
    int		x;		/* left edge of bits */
    uchar	top;		/* first non-zero scan-line */
    uchar	bottom;		/* last non-zero scan-line + 1 */

    // adjustments to make on drawing point coordinates in destination
    schar	left;		/* offset of baseline */
    uchar	width;		/* width of baseline */
};
@
%c: finer grained int so can optimize layout on disk
%ocaml: just int everywhere? 
\t FIGURE, the comment of Subfont explains things quite good actually.

% cachechars(2): source
% "The pixels to be displayed for character c are in the
% rectangle (i->x, i->top, (i+1)->x, i->bottom) where i is
% &subfont->info[c]. "

% in libmemdraw/string.c, code used only by vgascreenputc, that is simpler
%  cos subfont already loaded:
%        memdraw(b, Rect(p.x + i->left, p.y + i->top, 
%                        p.x + i->left + (i[1].x -i[0].x), p.y+i->bottom),
%                  color, cp, f->bits, Pt(i->x, i->top), SoverD);


\l not always same top and bottom? no cos chars have different
\l  height and width and interspacing rules, so need adjustments?

% target:
% "When a character is displayed at Point p in an
% image, the character rectangle is placed at (p.x + i->left, p.y) and
% the next character of the string is displayed at (p.x + i->width, p.y)"

\l why left and width different from Fontchar.x and Fontchar.x + 1 ?


<<[[Subfont]] other fields>>=
uchar		height;		/* height of image */
char		ascent;		/* top of image to baseline */
@
\l why different size than the one in Font? why not short here too?

% map Rune hashcode actually to FChar via big array. 
% Hashing done user side actually. 
% populated by loadchar().

% can contain glyphs of different subfonts!

% merge with Fontchar? no, this is different cos contain full info,
%  no need to do the x+1 gymnatstic.

    uchar   maxy;   /* last non-zero scan-line + 1 */

    schar   left;   /* offset of baseline */
    uchar   width;  /* width of baseline */

\section{Writing images to the disk}

%topng </dev/screen >screen.png :) = Grab

% will call unloadimage

% actually always write in compressed format, not even a bool
%  to say whether want compression












\chapter{Input Devices}
\label{chap:input}

%trans: why talk about input in book mostly about output (Graphics)?
% because one important input, mouse, strongly related to Graphics
% (historically too).
% Actually mouse has also some output feedback: the cursor! 
% (ok can have cursor in text mode with gpm, but not the same)


% event vs thread model

\section{Mouse}

%example:
% show toy app code using mouse? which calls initmouse (non-event version)
% and then readmouse(), draw coords, and quit when middle click.

\subsection{[[/dev/mouse]] interface}

% bind("#m", "/dev")

% show kernel interface and refer to Kernel.nw

% can read /dev/mouse? yes first char code and then 5 numbers
%  using 12 chars (so readable interface!)
% e.g.
% $ cat /dev/mouse
% m xxx yyy zzz www ppp
% then move around and see update!

% can write on /dev/mouse? yes to change position, see moveto()

%trans:
% program could use directly /dev/mouse. Nice, easy.
% But then synchrone ... annoying. Need another model!

\subsection{Additional data structures}
% [[mouse.h]] interface
% user side

<<struct [[Mouse]]>>=
struct	Mouse
{
    Point	xy;
    // bitset<enum<Click>>
    buttons	buttons;	/* bit array: LMR=124 */

    ulong	msec;
};
@
\l same in mouse.h and event.h, could factorize chunks?

\t msec? since last time?

<<type [[buttons]]>>=
// bitset<enum<Click>>
typedef int buttons;
@
%pad: I introduced that

<<enum [[Click]]>>=
enum Click {
    CLICK_LEFT = 1,
    CLICK_MIDDLE = 2,
    CLICK_RIGHT = 4,
};
@
%pad: I introduced that
\l should use that in Windows.nw then!

% /dev/mouse and /dev/cursor handler

<<struct [[Mousectl]]>>=
struct Mousectl
{
    Mouse;

    // /dev/mouse
    fdt		mfd;		/* to mouse file */ 
    // ref_own<filename>
    char	*file; // "/dev/mouse" usually

    // ref<Image>
    Image*	image;	/* of associated window/display */

    <<[[Mousectl]] channel fields>>
    <<[[Mousectl]] IO process field>>
    <<[[Mousectl]] cursor field>>
};
@
%ctor = initmouse
%ocaml: just mfd. Also separate Mouse from Mousectl. If want
% to pass mouse information then you need to pass both a mousectl and a mouse
% update: still good design? not sure cos force to return and pass more
% stuff around
%ocaml: no image here, more explicit again in caller when call
% flush_and_read display mousectl

% Image here! so kinda depends on graphics. why need image? 
%thanks to rio-in-ocaml (and especially menu_widget.ml), discovered
% that when you read the mouse you want first the display to be uptodate
% but you dont want reach time to do Display.flush display; Mouse.receive ...
% you want the Mouse.receive to do that internally! see readmouse()


% use kencc extension above. Inline struct. See Compiler.nw book.
% kinda poor's man inheritance, so can use mc as a mouse and do
% things like mc->x, mc->buttons, no need mc->mouse->buttons.

% synchrone issue solved by plan9 concurrent model, use channel,
% so code can listen without blocking! But need trick.

<<[[Mousectl]] IO process field>>=
int		pid;	/* of slave proc */
@
% keep pid so can kill it when closemouse()
%ocaml: ocaml threads alleviate need for proc/thread, non-blocking IO

<<[[Mousectl]] channel fields>>=
// chan<Mouse> (listener = user program, sender = _ioproc(mouse.c))
Channel	*c;			/* chan(Mouse) */
@
%ocaml: typed channels!

% so code who wants to read info must
%  recv(mymc->c, &mymouseinfo)
%  and can use alt()! so non blocking. Event!
% See Libcore.nw

% 0 so no buffering?
%ocaml: typed channels!

@
%ocaml: create thread instead. threads use non-blocking IO!

% pass around mc

% "server" of mouse information.

% Why in another proc? Why not a thread? because plan9 thread lib
%  are actually blocking when doing IO (a bit like in ocaml originally?)
%  so need extra process wrapper.

\chapter{Overlapping Layers}
\label{chap:overlapping-windows}

% kind of window.
% but not process associated, so better use term layer, but in the end
% used for windows! by rio!
% rename allocwindow() to alloclayer?

% See \cite{pike-layers}!

% put another code orga here? desktop.c, window.c, good stuff!
% stuff in libdraw/desktop.c, and also now stuff in kernel/.../drawwindow.c

%libdraw/window.c: image "layers" (hmm but actually not transparent right now)
%libdraw/desktop.c
%kernel/devices/screen/drawwindow.c

%adapter:
% draw.c: again, memdraw(), but should be in libmemdraw/
% line.c: again! memline(), but should be only for horizontal/vert here no?
% load.c:
% unload.c:

%layerop.c

%lalloc.c: memlayer alloc
%ldelete.c: memlayer free

%lsetrefresh.c

%window operations:
% lorigin.c: mv window (or its origin)
% lhide.c: expose/hide window
% ltofront.c: back to top
% ltorear.c: put to rear






% actually Window is a bad name (see pike paper?)

% See window(2)! have even nice examples at the end.

% lib_graphics/docs/pike-bitmap.ps, with layerop(), and many
% other stuff.

% Put toy example showing use of windows, A la acme, all in one,
% where also see overlapping idea.
% What if windows is overlapped by many other windows? Tricky
% for draw operations to not overflow.

% FIGURE screenshot of result of toy example.

% Core idea is that can have overlapping independent images, can move on top,
% move on the back. It also saves the old content when overlapped.
% It manages that for you. You don't have to care. Just draw in your
% windows as usual.
% Can also have a logical coordinate system so even if window
% on the right, its upper left can still be set to Pt(0,0).

% Note that when draw anything on it, it will handle if part of the image
% is overlapped and save this part somewhere if window is put to front later
% (if use default refresh mechanism).
% It means it needs to intercept all drawing operations.

%alt: or it could draw everything on save image, and this save image
% could be paint back on the main screen (in the right order of windows).
% that would remove lots of code. Does not even have to do the
% coordinate translation each time as save use the logical coordinates.
% In fact Lisp Machine was doing that, "shadow bitmap" and pike called
% his layerop an optimization of this shadow bitmap technique.

% Not only the windowing system can use windows. Acme uses windows.
% But of course this is a big building block for windowing system.

% What we have seen was already very complicated, lots of architecture layers,
% wrapper data structures. A real onion.
% Here is another one :) Windows and Desktops (Screen).

%alt: in X11 no shadow bitmap, it is responsibility of programs to repaint
% possibly to optimize by repainting only subareas,
% possibly to remove other expose event, ... this
% complicates client programs

% See Sundew paper, good principle says to not bother client with that!
% that memory is cheap now, can have shadow bitmap!


\section{Additional data structures}

\subsection{Base layer: [[Screen]] (and [[Memscreen]])}
\n use BaseLayer, more consistent with Photoshop, and base image gives
\n  idea that it is an image when really it is another data structure.

\subsubsection{[[Screen]]}

% to create windows, first need Desktop(Screen) holding them all.
% Screen factorize for all windows the target image and filling image.

% The id field allows to sync with similar structure in kernel.

% ctor = allocscreen | publicscreen
<<struct [[Screen]]>>=
struct Screen
{
    Display *display;   /* display holding data */
    int     id;         /* id of system-held Screen */

    Image   *image;     /* unused; for reference only */
    Image   *fill;      /* color to paint behind windows */
};
@
% unused in user space yes. fill also unused?
%todo: rename? Confusing with Vga screen, screeimage, etc.
% maybe Desktop? After all that's the term Macos uses, with also the
% notion of virtual desktops. You have a desktop where you can put
% papers, papers which can overlap on the desktop.
%update: rename BaseLayer?

% display not redundant with Screen.fill.display? 
% yes, but because we dont need the fill (the information is stored 
% server-side), the only thing we need is really the display to communicate
% with the server.

\subsubsection{[[DScreen]]}

% kernel side, D for Draw (device).
% A bit like DImage for Image but here for Screen.

<<struct [[DScreen]]>>=
struct DScreen
{
    int     id;

    DImage      *dimage;
    DImage      *dfill;

    <<[[DScreen]] other fields>>

    // Extra
    int     ref;
    <<[[DScreen]] extra fields>>
};
@
% DImage screen
% ref here! cos can be made public and shared 

<<[[DScreen]] other fields>>=
bool     public;
@
% could mv in rio chapter.


<<global [[dscreen]]>>=
// list<ref<DScreen>> (next = DScreen.next)
static  DScreen*    dscreen;
@
% for publicscreen all public screens are shared and so stored globally
% in dscreen

<<[[DScreen]] extra fields>>=
// list<ref<DScreen>> (head = dscreen)
DScreen*    next;
@

% drawmesg (public screen) -> <>
<<function [[drawlookupdscreen]]>>=
DScreen*
drawlookupdscreen(int id)
{
    DScreen *s;

    s = dscreen;
    while(s){
        if(s->id == id)
            return s;
        s = s->next;
    }
    return nil;
}
@



\subsubsection{[[CScreen]]}
\l CDesktop

% one client can have multiple screens, so need lookup screen id
% so need list of those screens.
% (a client can create a subdesktop inside its desktop!).

% CScreen = Client screens

<<[[Client]] layer fields>>=
// list<ref_own<DScreen>> (next = CScreen.next)
CScreen*    cscreen;
@
% a bit like DImage hash, but here it's simply a list.
% probably because in practice a client has only one screen.
% Faster than dscreen big list.

% ctor = drawinstallscreen
<<struct [[CScreen]]>>=
struct CScreen
{
    // ref_shared<DScreen>
    DScreen*    dscreen;

    CScreen*    next;
};
@
%alt: could have embed that in DScreen itself, have a nextbis field.



% drawmesg (free screen) | drawmesg (allocate window) -> <>
<<function [[drawlookupscreen]]>>=
DScreen*
drawlookupscreen(Client *client, int id, CScreen **cs)
{
    CScreen *s;

    s = client->cscreen;
    while(s){
        if(s->dscreen->id == id){
            *cs = s;
            return s->dscreen;
        }
        s = s->next;
    }
    error(Enodrawscreen);
    return nil;
}
@




<<[[DScreen]] other fields>>=
Client*     owner;
@
% when private screen apparently the same client can access it too, but
% then need this information stored in the DScreen.
\l could delete I think, weird to allow use-public-screen message on
\l  non-public screen


\subsubsection{[[Memscreen]]}

% kernel independent. no id here.

<<[[DScreen]] other fields>>=
// ref_own<Memscreen>
Memscreen*  screen;
@

% why another DS? why not merge in DScreen? because of libmemdraw
% to be independent of kernel. In fact acme probably uses memscreen directly
% and no DScreen.

<<struct [[Memscreen]]>>=
struct Memscreen
{
    Memimage	*image;		/* upon which all layers are drawn */
    Memimage	*fill;		/* if non-zero, picture to use when repainting */

    <<[[Memscreen]] stack windows fields>>
};
@
% The image and fill seems redundant with same DScreen field, but
%  again it's because of kernel independence.
% Maybe the kernel one could be removed?

% Memscreen.image->data will be shared among all windows,
% with a different rectangle part each time.



\subsection{Layer (and [[Memlayer]])}

% Windows are images! They just have a few more operations available to
% them. But they need to be connected to a desktop.

<<[[Image]] layer fields>>=
Screen      *screen;    /* nil if not a window */
@
\t dead? seems used only in freeimage, and mostly to
\t  maintain Display.windows which itself seems dead
\t so information useful only server-side I think

<<[[DImage]] layer fields>>=
DScreen*    dscreen;    /* nil if not a window */
@
% seems redundant with Memimage.screen, but here it's a DScreen
%  not a kernel independent Memscreen.

% Actually for DImage got by name, the dscreen field will
% not be set because of nil passed below:
%    if(drawinstall(client, dstid, dn->dimage->image, nil) == 0)
% but the underlying memimage will have its layer and screen set.


\subsubsection{[[Memlayer]]}

% Could have also a 
% <<[[Memimage]] layer fields>>=
% Memscreen* *mscreen;
% but instead it's done in the Memlayer intermediate structure
%  with more info.


<<[[MemImage]] layer fields>>=
// ref_own<Memlayer>
Memlayer	*layer;	/* nil if not a layer*/
@
% why call that layer? cos additional layer when do draw operation
% on them? to translate, clip, save, etc.

% additional info on image related to window management.

% ref to Memscreen below so will share pixel data of screen.image!
% Also will give access to other windows in this Screen, which will
% be needed when move around this window, to obscure/save and expose
% other windows.

% can move around the window on the desktop/screen image via screenr.
% can move its origin via delta.

% Memlayer is really an adapter to a shared Memdata.
% The Memimage of a window will be similar to the underlying full screen
%  image but thx to the layer link draw operation will know which
%  actual part of the shared full screen image to touch.

<<struct [[Memlayer]]>>=
struct Memlayer
{
    Rectangle		screenr;	/* true position of layer on screen */
    Point			delta;	/* add delta to go from image coords to screen */

    // ref<Memscreen>
    Memscreen	*screen;	/* screen this layer belongs to */

    // ref_own<Memimage> (in image coords)
    Memimage	*save;	/* save area for obscured parts */


    <<[[Memlayer]] stack windows fields>>
    <<[[Memlayer]] refresh fields>>
    <<[[Memlayer]] other fields>>
};
@
%alt: have the Memimage be the save image, with the data of the save
% image, instead of the data to the full screen image, and then after
% each draw op copy from save to full screen (found in Memscreen).
% Need clipping though, and because of arbitrary overlap, can not just
% have one rectangle, but could have a list of rectangles, or simply
% each time redraw as a painter.

%alt: could use screen coord for save too, would save conversion
% issues back and forth in memlayerop and memdraw

% Memlayer.screenr different from Memimage.r?

<<[[Memlayer]] other fields>>=
bool		clear;	/* layer is fully visible */
@
% what need clear for? optimisations, to know if need to get
%  pixels from save or not. When fully visible then things are
%  simpler

%alt: [[save]] saves only the obscured parts. Maybe an alternative would
% be for [[save]] to contain everything, and each time there is an update
% to copy accordingly [[save]] to the main screen in a painter fashion
% (last stuff painted overwrite previous stuff).
% Might be slower, but far more simpler than what they do where
% they really optimise and draw only what is necessary. Even the background
% is rendered on demand when a window disappear. 


%\subsubsection{Summary}

% FIGURE where could see in // the 3 universe, Image, DImage, Memimage
%  and also Screen, DScreen, Memscreen, and the pointers in both
%  directions each time.




\subsubsection{[[Display.windows]]}

%dead:
<<[[Display]] other fields>>=
// list<ref<Window>> (next = Image.next)
Image   *windows;
@
<<[[Image]] extra fields>>=
Image       *next;  /* next in list of windows */
@

\t I think it's dead, no need that, it's maintained in allocwindow
\t  and freeimage but nobody is using those fields then.


\subsection{Layer stack}

% double linked list of windows.

<<[[Memscreen]] stack windows fields>>=
// list<ref<Memimage>> (next = Memimage.layer->rear)
Memimage	*frontmost;	/* frontmost layer on screen */
// list<ref<Memimage>> (next = Memimage.layer->front)
Memimage	*rearmost;	/* rearmost layer on screen */
@


<<[[Memlayer]] stack windows fields>>=
Memimage	*front;	/* window in front of this one */
Memimage	*rear;	/* window behind this one*/
@

% remember that each Memlayer has a ref to Memscreen and so has
% access to the other windows, which will be needed when move around
% this Memlayer/window, to hide(save)/expose(restore) other windows.

\section{Drawing and Layers}

%trans:
% Most drawing code we presented before for images handle basic images 
% but not windows. A window is mostly an image, but not exactly an image:
% We need first to adapt coordinates and then draw on
% underlying screen image or draw on save depending if area is visible or not.
% So need many adaptations to drawing algo we saw before. Cant just
% draw with coord on full underlying screen (shared) image.

%alt: just draw on save and use painter algorithm, far simpler.

\subsection{Drawing rectangles on overlapping layers}

%trans:
% seen memdraw() in chapter X. But for simple case where src and
% dst are simple images, not windows, in which case call
% the simple memimagedraw().
% Here adaptations when one of the image is actually a window in which case we 
% need to translate image coords to actual screen coord and possibly draw in 
% save area instead if destination is a window. We may also have
% to take pixels from the save area if src is a partially obscured window.

\subsubsection{[[memdraw()]]}

%old:   DBG1("drawclip dstcr %R srccr %R maskcr %R\n", dst->clipr, src->clipr, mask->clipr);

% What if different coordinate system? If dst is regular image but
% src a window? Does not matter. Logically the coord of the window
% are the coord we mean for the data. It's not the real one because
% we share an image, but the user does not have to care about that.

\subsubsection{Coordinate conversions}

<<[[memdraw()]] convert [[r]] if dst is a window>>=
if(dl != nil){
    // r = rectaddpt(r, dl->delta)
    r.min.x += dl->delta.x;

    srcr.min.x += sl->delta.x;
    srcr.min.y += sl->delta.y;
    srcr.max.x += sl->delta.x;
    srcr.max.y += sl->delta.y;
}
@

\subsubsection{Source conversion}

<<[[memdraw()]] make src an image>>=
if(sl){
    <<[[memdraw()]] if src is fully visible can optimize>>

    /* relatively rare case; use save area */
    <<[[memdraw()]] if refresh function for src>>
    memlhide(src, srcr); // draw the needed pixels in sl->save

    /* convert back to logical coordinates */
    // p0 = subpt(p0, sl->delta)
    p0.x -= sl->delta.x;
    p0.y -= sl->delta.y;
    // srcr = rectsubpt(srcr, sl->delta)
    srcr.min.x -= sl->delta.x;
    srcr.min.y -= sl->delta.y;
    srcr.max.x -= sl->delta.x;
    srcr.max.y -= sl->delta.y;

    src = src->layer->save; // progress
}
@
% note that memlhide -> _memlayerop -> memdraw, so kinda recursif,
% but the memdraw will be with src->layer->save, a simple image.

% convert back to logical because sl->save have data with logical coords.

\subsubsection{Shortcuts}

<<[[memdraw()]] if dst is fully visible can optimize>>=
Clearlayer:

    if(src == dst){
        // p0 = addpt(p0, dl->delta)

% note that maybe src != dst and still a layer in which case one

\chapter{Windowing System Support}
\label{chap:windowing-support}

%trans:
% Saw windows chapter before. Can be used for regular app. e.g., acme.
% Will be used by rio. Actually used by every app by default too as we will see.
% Saw Naming images section before. Can be used for interprocess sharing.
% A few more pieces (/dev/winname) and enough building blocks for rio.

% rio overview: when run, access to full screen, direct access to
% /dev/draw (actually even rio go through initdraw and so have screen
% and view, but when noborder screenname, a bit special).
% Then with screen create subwindows when special command with mouse,
% then associate process with this screen and emulate /dev/winname
%  for this process.
% (and also public screen but actually less important)
% every app use initdraw(), so can put stuff there to setup things.


% Also fast windowing system because even if window, draw directly 
% on frame buffer! (actually can mess up with Display->image)
%alt: 8 1/2 was virtualizing the window too, cleaner, and more
% elegant, but slower apparently. Maybe could not have games in a window
% then. Also would be safer! any app can draw on desktop ! maybe can
% do tricky stuff to fool the user?

% see window(2) discussion at the end about rio and initdraw.
% rio creates a public screen, with public windows (images).
% then builds a screen for each window, then a border (a window?)
% and then a subwindow for the client.

\section{Additional data structures}

% every window run will have view and screen set accordingly.

\subsection{[[view]]}

<<global [[view]]>>=
// ref<Image>, a window
Image	*view;
@
% gengetwindow(..., &view) <- geninitdraw <- initdraw
%old: was called screen, but unfortunate because there was
% also a Screen type and then a _screen global.
% I could maybe also call it image, or window.
% At the same time with the virtual screen principle, every app thinks it has
% the whole screen for itself, so maybe it made sense to call this
% variable screen. But view is good too, less confusing.
% Actually rio uses a 'view' global assigned to screen.
%ocaml: does not need to be a global

% it is not the same than Display->image! (or Display->screenimage?)
% it comes from gengetwindown so it is really the window image!
% it should be smaller than Display->image (unless not run under rio).

% It has a backing store too?


% Why need to be a global? convenient, just call initdraw and everything
% is set for you.


\subsection{[[screen]]}

<<global [[screen]]>>=
Screen	*screen;
@
% gengetwindow(..., &screen) <- geninitdraw <- initdraw
%old: was called _screen because screen was already use 
%  (to actually an Image, hmm), but I s/screen/view so now screen is free.
%ocaml: does not need to be a global
\t rename desktop? (even if actually it's a subdesktop)

% screen is not screen of rio! it's actually a subscreen
% where client can create window in. Need subscreen because
% otherwise client could move around its own window? and need
% screen because only way for client to create its own window in it.
%(note that can still mess with Display->image, ugly)
