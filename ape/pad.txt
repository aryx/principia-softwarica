I've made a few modifications to this directory
 - I put pcc/ here instead of at the top of sys/src/cmd (or instead
   of compilers/)
 - I put the include/ape here instead
   and did the same for 386/include/ape and arm/include/ape which
   are now instead subdirs in ape/include

The reasons for all of that is to gather all ape related things
in this directory to not pollute my other directories.
