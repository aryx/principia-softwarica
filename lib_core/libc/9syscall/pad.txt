This directory will contain for each syscall a small .s file
linked in libc. The name of the .s and function it contains is
derived from the syscall name, e.g. SEMACQUIRE will generate
a semacquire.s file containing a small semacquire function.

There is an exception for exits which generate a _exits function.
Not sure why ...
