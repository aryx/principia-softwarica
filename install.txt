To compile and install Plan9, you need a working Plan9 environment.
Indeed, the C source code of Plan9 uses a special dialect of C
that is supported only by the Plan9 C compiler (not gcc, not clang).
Moreover, the few assembly files also requires the Plan9 assemblers (not gas).
Finally, the building process relies on many Plan9 tools (e.g., mk, rc),
or UNIX tools (e.g., ar, yacc, grep, sed, xd)
using Plan9-specific options found only on Plan9 (not the GNU utilities).

Thus, one option to compile this repository is to install first the original
Plan9, for example, by using a live CD (see https://9p.io/plan9/download.html).

Another option is to cross-compile this repository from Linux or MacOS.
Indeed, some of the Plan9 tools have been ported to those operating systems.
Then, you must first install:
 - a C cross compiler that can handle Plan9 code,
   see https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - the mk build tool, the rc shell, and other Plan9 utilities
   see http://swtch.com/plan9port/

Then you'll need to adapt and source env.sh to setup the right environment 
(essentially to find the compilers in kencc/ and rc/mk in plan9port).


If you want to typeset the books of the Principia Softwarica series,
you will also need: 
 - TeX and LaTeX (and hack report.cls for getting two columns TOC)
 - noweb
 - syncweb (which itself requires ocaml to compile)
   see https://github.com/aryx/syncweb
