Before compiling and installing Plan9, you must first install:
 - a C cross compiler that can handle Plan9 code,
   see https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - the mk build tool and the rc shell
   see http://swtch.com/plan9port/

Then you'll need to adapt and source env.sh to setup the right environment 
(essentially to find the compilers in kencc/ and rc/mk in plan9port).


If you want to typeset the documents you'll also need: 
 - TeX and LaTeX (and hack report.cls for getting two columns TOC)
 - noweb
 - syncweb (which itself requires ocaml to compile)
   see https://github.com/aryx/syncweb
