You must first install:
 - a C cross compiler that can handle plan9 code,
   see https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - the mk build tool and the rc shell, both parts of plan9port
   see http://swtch.com/plan9port/

Then you'll need to adapt and source env.sh to setup the right environment 
(essentially to find the compilers in kencc/ and rc/mk in plan9port)
You'll also need to setup /386 /sys/ /lib appropriate symlinks 
(this is a bit gross ...) as well as /bin/mk and /bin/rc symlinks.
See 'make setup_host' in Makefile.

If you want to typeset the documents you'll also need: 
 - TeX and LaTeX
 - noweb

If you want to modify the documents and synchronize with the code, you'll
also need:
 - syncweb
   see https://github.com/aryx/syncweb
