You must first install:
 - a C cross compiler that can handle plan9 code,
   see https://github.com/aryx/fork-kencc
 - the mk build tool and the rc shell
   see http://swtch.com/plan9port/

Then you'll need to adapt and source env.sh to setup the right environment 
(essentially to find the compilers in kencc/ and rc/mk in plan9port)
You'll also need to setup /386 /sys/ /lib appropriate symlinks 
(this is a bit gross ...). See 'make setup_host' in the toplevel Makefile.

If you want to typeset the documents you'll also need: 
 - TeX and LaTeX (and hack report.cls for getting two columns TOC)
 - noweb

If you want to modify the documents and synchronize with the code, you'll
also need:
 - syncweb (which itself requires ocaml to compile)
   see https://github.com/aryx/syncweb
